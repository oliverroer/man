<p class="Pp">This is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard
    calls from the system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as
    well as authentication. Usually this is obtained from the /etc/passwd and
    the /etc/shadow file as well if shadow is enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">The account component performs the task of establishing the status
    of the user's account and password based on the following <i>shadow</i>
    elements: expire, last_change, max_change, min_change, warn_change. In the
    case of the latter, it may offer advice to the user on changing their
    password or, through the <b>PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD</b> return, delay giving
    service to the user until they have established a new password. The entries
    listed above are documented in the <b>shadow</b>(5) manual page. Should the
    user's record not contain one or more of these entries, the corresponding
    <i>shadow</i> check is not performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The authentication component performs the task of checking the
    users credentials (password). The default action of this module is to not
    permit the user access to a service if their official password is blank.</p>
<p class="Pp">A helper binary, <b>unix_chkpwd</b>(8), is provided to check the
    user's password when it is stored in a read protected database. This binary
    is very simple and will only check the password of the user invoking it. It
    is called transparently on behalf of the user by the authenticating
    component of this module. In this way it is possible for applications like
    <b>xlock</b>(1) to work without being setuid-root. The module, by default,
    will temporarily turn off SIGCHLD handling for the duration of execution of
    the helper binary. This is generally the right thing to do, as many
    applications are not prepared to handle this signal from a child they didn't
    know was <b>fork()</b>d. The <b>noreap</b> module argument can be used to
    suppress this temporary shielding and may be needed for use with certain
    applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">The maximum length of a password supported by the pam_unix module
    via the helper binary is <i>PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE</i> - currently 512 bytes. The
    rest of the password provided by the conversation function to the module
    will be ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The password component of this module performs the task of
    updating the user's password. The default encryption hash is taken from the
    <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b> variable from <i>/etc/login.defs</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The session component of this module logs when a user logins or
    leave the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remaining arguments, supported by others functions of this module,
    are silently ignored. Other arguments are logged as errors through
    <b>syslog</b>(3).</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">debug</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turns on debugging via <b>syslog</b>(3).</div>
<p class="Pp">audit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A little more extreme than debug.</div>
<p class="Pp">quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turns off informational messages namely messages about
  session open and close via <b>syslog</b>(3).</div>
<p class="Pp">nullok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default action of this module is to not permit the
  user access to a service if their official password is blank. The
  <b>nullok</b> argument overrides this default.</div>
<p class="Pp">nullresetok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow users to authenticate with blank password if
  password reset is enforced even if <b>nullok</b> is not set. If password reset
  is not required and <b>nullok</b> is not set the authentication with blank
  password will be denied.</div>
<p class="Pp">try_first_pass</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before prompting the user for their password, the module
  first tries the previous stacked module's password in case that satisfies this
  module as well.</div>
<p class="Pp">use_first_pass</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The argument <b>use_first_pass</b> forces the module to
  use a previous stacked modules password and will never prompt the user - if no
  password is available or the password is not appropriate, the user will be
  denied access.</div>
<p class="Pp">nodelay</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This argument can be used to discourage the
  authentication component from requesting a delay should the authentication as
  a whole fail. The default action is for the module to request a
  delay-on-failure of the order of two second.</div>
<p class="Pp">use_authtok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When password changing enforce the module to set the new
  password to the one provided by a previously stacked <b>password</b> module
  (this is used in the example of the stacking of the <b>pam_passwdqc</b> module
  documented below).</div>
<p class="Pp">authtok_type=type</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This argument can be used to modify the password prompt
  when changing passwords to include the type of the password. Empty by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">nis</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">NIS RPC is used for setting new passwords.</div>
<p class="Pp">remember=n</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The last <i>n</i> passwords for each user are saved in
  /etc/security/opasswd in order to force password change history and keep the
  user from alternating between the same password too frequently. The MD5
  password hash algorithm is used for storing the old passwords. Instead of this
  option the <b>pam_pwhistory</b> module should be used.</div>
<p class="Pp">shadow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Try to maintain a shadow based system.</div>
<p class="Pp">md5</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the MD5 algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">bigcrypt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the DEC C2 algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">sha256</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the SHA256 algorithm. The SHA256 algorithm must be supported by the
  <b>crypt</b>(3) function.</div>
<p class="Pp">sha512</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the SHA512 algorithm. The SHA512 algorithm must be supported by the
  <b>crypt</b>(3) function.</div>
<p class="Pp">blowfish</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the blowfish algorithm. The blowfish algorithm must be supported by the
  <b>crypt</b>(3) function.</div>
<p class="Pp">gost_yescrypt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the gost-yescrypt algorithm. The gost-yescrypt algorithm must be supported by
  the <b>crypt</b>(3) function.</div>
<p class="Pp">yescrypt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a user changes their password next, encrypt it with
  the yescrypt algorithm. The yescrypt algorithm must be supported by the
  <b>crypt</b>(3) function.</div>
<p class="Pp">rounds=n</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the optional number of rounds of the SHA256, SHA512,
  blowfish, gost-yescrypt, and yescrypt password hashing algorithms to
  <i>n</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">broken_shadow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore errors reading shadow information for users in the
  account management module.</div>
<p class="Pp">minlen=n</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set a minimum password length of <i>n</i> characters. The
  default value is 6. The maximum for DES crypt-based passwords is 8
  characters.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>obscure</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable some extra checks on password strength. These
  checks are based on the &quot;obscure&quot; checks in the original shadow
  package. The behavior is similar to the pam_cracklib module, but for
  non-dictionary-based checks. The following checks are implemented:
<p class="Pp"><b>Palindrome</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verifies that the new password is not a palindrome of
  (i.e., the reverse of) the previous one.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Case Change Only</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verifies that the new password isn't the same as the old
  one with a change of case.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Similar</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verifies that the new password isn't too much like the
  previous one.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Simple</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Is the new password too simple? This is based on the
  length of the password and the number of different types of characters (alpha,
  numeric, etc.) used.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Rotated</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Is the new password a rotated version of the old
  password? (E.g., &quot;billy&quot; and &quot;illyb&quot;)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">no_pass_expiry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set ignore password expiration as defined by the
  <i>shadow</i> entry of the user. The option has an effect only in case
  <i>pam_unix</i> was not used for the authentication or it returned
  authentication failure meaning that other authentication source or method
  succeeded. The example can be public key authentication in <i>sshd</i>. The
  module will return <b>PAM_SUCCESS</b> instead of eventual
  <b>PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD</b> or <b>PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">Invalid arguments are logged with <b>syslog</b>(3).</p>
