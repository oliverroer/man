<p class="Pp"><b>e2fsck</b> is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file
    systems. For ext3 and ext4 file systems that use a journal, if the system
    has been shut down uncleanly without any errors, normally, after replaying
    the committed transactions in the journal, the file system should be marked
    as clean. Hence, for file systems that use journaling, <b>e2fsck</b> will
    normally replay the journal and exit, unless its superblock indicates that
    further checking is required.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>device</i> is a block device (e.g., <i>/dev/sdc1</i>) or file
    containing the file system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in general it is not safe to run <b>e2fsck</b> on
    mounted file systems. The only exception is if the <b>-n</b> option is
    specified, and <b>-c</b>, <b>-l</b>, or <b>-L</b> options are <i>not</i>
    specified. However, even if it is safe to do so, the results printed by
    <b>e2fsck</b> are not valid if the file system is mounted. If <b>e2fsck</b>
    asks whether or not you should check a file system which is mounted, the
    only correct answer is ``no''. Only experts who really know what they are
    doing should consider answering this question in any other way.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>e2fsck</b> is run in interactive mode (meaning that none of
    <b>-y</b>, <b>-n</b>, or <b>-p</b> are specified), the program will ask the
    user to fix each problem found in the file system. A response of 'y' will
    fix the error; 'n' will leave the error unfixed; and 'a' will fix the
    problem and all subsequent problems; pressing Enter will proceed with the
    default response, which is printed before the question mark. Pressing
    Control-C terminates e2fsck immediately.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option does the same thing as the <b>-p</b> option. It is provided
      for backwards compatibility only; it is suggested that people use
      <b>-p</b> option whenever possible.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b><i> superblock</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Instead of using the normal superblock, use an alternative superblock
      specified by <i>superblock</i>. This option is normally used when the
      primary superblock has been corrupted. The location of backup superblocks
      is dependent on the file system's blocksize, the number of blocks per
      group, and features such as <b>sparse_super</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Additional backup superblocks can be determined by using the <b>mke2fs</b>
      program using the <b>-n</b> option to print out where the superblocks
      exist, supposing <b>mke2fs</b> is supplied with arguments that are
      consistent with the file system's layout (e.g. blocksize, blocks per
      group, <b>sparse_super</b>, etc.).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If an alternative superblock is specified and the file system is not
      opened read-only, e2fsck will make sure that the primary superblock is
      updated appropriately upon completion of the file system check.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><b>-B</b><i> blocksize</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, <b>e2fsck</b> will search for the superblock at various
      different block sizes in an attempt to find the appropriate block size.
      This search can be fooled in some cases. This option forces <b>e2fsck</b>
      to only try locating the superblock at a particular blocksize. If the
      superblock is not found, <b>e2fsck</b> will terminate with a fatal
    error.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option causes <b>e2fsck</b> to use <b>badblocks</b>(8) program to do
      a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad blocks. If any bad
      blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to prevent them
      from being allocated to a file or directory. If this option is specified
      twice, then the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive
      read-write test.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>-C</b><i> fd</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option causes <b>e2fsck</b> to write completion information to the
      specified file descriptor so that the progress of the file system check
      can be monitored. This option is typically used by programs which are
      running <b>e2fsck</b>. If the file descriptor number is negative, then
      absolute value of the file descriptor will be used, and the progress
      information will be suppressed initially. It can later be enabled by
      sending the <b>e2fsck</b> process a SIGUSR1 signal. If the file descriptor
      specified is 0, <b>e2fsck</b> will print a completion bar as it goes about
      its business. This requires that e2fsck is running on a video console or
      terminal.</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print debugging output (useless unless you are debugging
    <b>e2fsck</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Optimize directories in file system. This option causes e2fsck to try to
      optimize all directories, either by re-indexing them if the file system
      supports directory indexing, or by sorting and compressing directories for
      smaller directories, or for file systems using traditional linear
      directories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Even without the <b>-D</b> option, <b>e2fsck</b> may sometimes optimize a
      few directories --- for example, if directory indexing is enabled and a
      directory is not indexed and would benefit from being indexed, or if the
      index structures are corrupted and need to be rebuilt. The <b>-D</b>
      option forces all directories in the file system to be optimized. This can
      sometimes make them a little smaller and slightly faster to search, but in
      practice, you should rarely need to use this option.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-D</b> option will detect directory entries with duplicate names in
      a single directory, which e2fsck normally does not enforce for performance
      reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><b>-E</b><i>
    extended_options</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Set e2fsck extended options. Extended options are comma separated, and may
      take an argument using the equals ('=') sign. The following options are
      supported:</dd>

  <dd>Set the version of the extended attribute blocks which <b>e2fsck</b> will
      require while checking the file system. The version number may be 1 or 2.
      The default extended attribute version format is 2.</dd>
  <dt id="journal_only"><a class="permalink" href="#journal_only"><b>journal_only</b></a></dt>

  <dt id="discard"><a class="permalink" href="#discard"><b>discard</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Attempt to discard free blocks and unused inode blocks after the full file
      system check (discarding blocks is useful on solid state devices and
      sparse / thin-provisioned storage). Note that discard is done in pass 5
      AFTER the file system has been fully checked and only if it does not
      contain recognizable errors. However there might be cases where
      <b>e2fsck</b> does not fully recognize a problem and hence in this case
      this option may prevent you from further manual data recovery.</dd>
  <dt id="nodiscard"><a class="permalink" href="#nodiscard"><b>nodiscard</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not attempt to discard free blocks and unused inode blocks. This option
      is exactly the opposite of discard option. This is set as default.</dd>
  <dt id="no_optimize_extents"><a class="permalink" href="#no_optimize_extents"><b>no_optimize_extents</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not offer to optimize the extent tree by eliminating unnecessary width
      or depth. This can also be enabled in the options section of

  <dt id="optimize_extents"><a class="permalink" href="#optimize_extents"><b>optimize_extents</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Offer to optimize the extent tree by eliminating unnecessary width or

  <dt id="inode_count_fullmap"><a class="permalink" href="#inode_count_fullmap"><b>inode_count_fullmap</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Trade off using memory for speed when checking a file system with a large
      number of hard-linked files. The amount of memory required is proportional
      to the number of inodes in the file system. For large file systems, this
      can be gigabytes of memory. (For example, a 40TB file system with 2.8
      billion inodes will consume an additional 5.7 GB memory if this
      optimization is enabled.) This optimization can also be enabled in the
      options section of <b>/etc/e2fsck.conf</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="no_inode_count_fullmap"><a class="permalink" href="#no_inode_count_fullmap"><b>no_inode_count_fullmap</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Disable the <b>inode_count_fullmap</b> optimization. This is the default
      unless otherwise specified in <b>/etc/e2fsck.conf</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="readahead_kb"><a class="permalink" href="#readahead_kb"><b>readahead_kb</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use this many KiB of memory to pre-fetch metadata in the hopes of reducing
      e2fsck runtime. By default, this is set to the size of two block groups'
      inode tables (typically 4MiB on a regular ext4 file system); if this
      amount is more than 1/50th of total physical memory, readahead is
      disabled. Set this to zero to disable readahead entirely.</dd>
  <dt id="bmap2extent"><a class="permalink" href="#bmap2extent"><b>bmap2extent</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Convert block-mapped files to extent-mapped files.</dd>
  <dt id="fixes_only"><a class="permalink" href="#fixes_only"><b>fixes_only</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Only fix damaged metadata; do not optimize htree directories or compress
      extent trees. This option is incompatible with the -D and -E bmap2extent
      options.</dd>
  <dt id="check_encoding"><a class="permalink" href="#check_encoding"><b>check_encoding</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Force verification of encoded filenames in case-insensitive directories.
      This is the default mode if the file system has the strict flag
    enabled.</dd>
  <dt id="unshare_blocks"><a class="permalink" href="#unshare_blocks"><b>unshare_blocks</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the file system has shared blocks, with the shared blocks read-only
      feature enabled, then this will unshare all shared blocks and unset the
      read-only feature bit. If there is not enough free space then the
      operation will fail. If the file system does not have the read-only
      feature bit, but has shared blocks anyway, then this option will have no
      effect. Note when using this option, if there is no free space to clone
      blocks, there is no prompt to delete files and instead the operation will
      fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that unshare_blocks implies the &quot;-f&quot; option to ensure that
      all passes are run. Additionally, if &quot;-n&quot; is also specified,
      e2fsck will simulate trying to allocate enough space to deduplicate. If
      this fails, the exit code will be non-zero.</dd>

  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Add the block numbers listed in the file specified by <i>filename</i> to
      the list of bad blocks. The format of this file is the same as the one
      generated by the <b>badblocks</b>(8) program. Note that the block numbers
      are based on the blocksize of the file system. Hence, <b>badblocks</b>(8)
      must be given the blocksize of the file system in order to obtain correct
      results. As a result, it is much simpler and safer to use the <b>-c</b>
      option to <b>e2fsck</b>, since it will assure that the correct parameters
      are passed to the <b>badblocks</b> program.</dd>
  <dt id="L"><a class="permalink" href="#L"><b>-L</b><i> filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the bad blocks list to be the list of blocks specified by
      <i>filename</i>. (This option is the same as the <b>-l</b> option, except

  <dd>Automatically repair (&quot;preen&quot;) the file system. This option will

<p class="Pp">Almost any piece of software will have bugs. If you manage to find
    a file system which causes <b>e2fsck</b> to crash, or which <b>e2fsck</b> is
    unable to repair, please report it to the author.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please include as much information as possible in your bug report.
    Ideally, include a complete transcript of the <b>e2fsck</b> run, so I can
    see exactly what error messages are displayed. (Make sure the messages
    printed by <b>e2fsck</b> are in English; if your system has been configured
    so that <b>e2fsck</b>'s messages have been translated into another language,
    please set the the <b>LC_ALL</b> environment variable to <b>C</b> so that
    the transcript of e2fsck's output will be useful to me.) If you have a
    writable file system where the transcript can be stored, the
    <b>script</b>(1) program is a handy way to save the output of <b>e2fsck</b>
    to a file.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also useful to send the output of <b>dumpe2fs</b>(8). If a
    specific inode or inodes seems to be giving <b>e2fsck</b> trouble, try
    running the <b>debugfs</b>(8) command and send the output of the
    <b>stat</b>(1u) command run on the relevant inode(s). If the inode is a
    directory, the <b>debugfs</b> <i>dump</i> command will allow you to extract
    the contents of the directory inode, which can sent to me after being first
    run through <b>uuencode</b>(1). The most useful data you can send to help
    reproduce the bug is a compressed raw image dump of the file system,
    generated using <b>e2image</b>(8). See the <b>e2image</b>(8) man page for
    more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Always include the full version string which <b>e2fsck</b>
    displays when it is run, so I know which version you are running.</p>
