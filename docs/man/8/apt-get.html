<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>apt-get</b> is the command-line tool for handling packages, and
    may be considered the user's &quot;back-end&quot; to other tools using the
    APT library. Several &quot;front-end&quot; interfaces exist, such as
    <b>aptitude</b>(8), <b>synaptic</b>(8) and <b>wajig</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless the <b>-h</b>, or <b>--help</b> option is given, one of the
    commands below must be present.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>update</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">update is used to resynchronize the package index files
  from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the
  location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a
  Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz files, so
  that information about new and updated packages is available. An update should
  always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that
  the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files
  cannot be known in advance.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>upgrade</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all
  packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
  /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions
  available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently
  installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and
  installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be
  upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left
  at their current version. An update must be performed first so that
  <b>apt-get</b> knows that new versions of packages are available.
<p class="Pp">When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be
    installed prior to the upgrade action.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>dist-upgrade</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of
  upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of
  packages; <b>apt-get</b> has a &quot;smart&quot; conflict resolution system,
  and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of
  less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may therefore
  remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of
  locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also
  <b>apt_preferences</b>(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings
  for individual packages.
<p class="Pp">When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be
    installed prior to the upgrade action.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>dselect-upgrade</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with the
  traditional Debian packaging front-end, <b>dselect</b>(1). dselect-upgrade
  follows the changes made by <b>dselect</b>(1) to the Status field of available
  packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize that state (for
  instance, the removal of old and the installation of new packages).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>install</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">install is followed by one or more packages desired for
  installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name, not a fully
  qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system, apt-utils would be the
  argument provided, not apt-utils_2.8.3_amd64.deb). All packages required by
  the package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved and
  installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the desired
  packages. If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with no intervening
  space), the identified package will be removed if it is installed. Similarly a
  plus sign can be used to designate a package to install. These latter features
  may be used to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution
  system.
<p class="Pp">A specific version of a package can be selected for installation
    by following the package name with an equals and the version of the package
    to select. This will cause that version to be located and selected for
    install. Alternatively a specific distribution can be selected by following
    the package name with a slash and the version of the distribution or the
    Archive name (stable, testing, unstable).</p>
<p class="Pp">Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages
    and must be used with care.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or more
    already-installed packages without upgrading every package you have on your
    system. Unlike the &quot;upgrade&quot; target, which installs the newest
    version of all currently installed packages, &quot;install&quot; will
    install the newest version of only the package(s) specified. Simply provide
    the name of the package(s) you wish to upgrade, and if a newer version is
    available, it (and its dependencies, as described above) will be downloaded
    and installed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the <b>apt_preferences</b>(5) mechanism allows you to
    create an alternative installation policy for individual packages.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no package matches the given expression and the expression
    contains one of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX regular
    expression, and it is applied to all package names in the database. Any
    matches are then installed (or removed). Note that matching is done by
    substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo' and 'lowest'. If this is undesired,
    anchor the regular expression with a '^' or '$' character, or create a more
    specific regular expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Fallback to regular expressions is deprecated in APT 2.0, has been
    removed in <b>apt</b>(8), except for anchored expressions, and will be
    removed from <b>apt-get</b>(8) in a future version. Use
    <b>apt-patterns</b>(7) instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>reinstall</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">reinstall is an alias for install --reinstall.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>remove</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">remove is identical to install except that packages are
  removed instead of installed. Note that removing a package leaves its
  configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to the package
  name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be installed
  instead of removed.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>purge</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">purge is identical to remove except that packages are
  removed and purged (any configuration files are deleted too).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>source</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">source causes <b>apt-get</b> to fetch source packages.
  APT will examine the available packages to decide which source package to
  fetch. It will then find and download into the current directory the newest
  available version of that source package while respecting the default release,
  set with the option APT::Default-Release, the <b>-t</b> option or per package
  with the pkg/release syntax, if possible.
<p class="Pp">The arguments are interpreted as binary and source package names.
    See the <b>--only-source</b> option if you want to change that.</p>
<p class="Pp">Source packages are tracked separately from binary packages via
    deb-src lines in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file. This means that you will
    need to add such a line for each repository you want to get sources from;
    otherwise you will probably get either the wrong (too old/too new) source
    versions or none at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>--compile</b> option is specified then the package will
    be compiled to a binary .deb using <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> for the
    architecture as defined by the <b>--host-architecture</b> option. If
    <b>--download-only</b> is specified then the source package will not be
    unpacked.</p>
<p class="Pp">A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the
    source name with an equals and then the version to fetch, similar to the
    mechanism used for the package files. This enables exact matching of the
    source package name and version, implicitly enabling the
    APT::Get::Only-Source option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that source packages are not installed and tracked in the
    <b>dpkg</b> database like binary packages; they are simply downloaded to the
    current directory, like source tarballs.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>build-dep</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">build-dep causes apt-get to install/remove packages in an
  attempt to satisfy the build dependencies for a source package. By default the
  dependencies are satisfied to build the package natively. If desired a
  host-architecture can be specified with the <b>--host-architecture</b> option
  instead.
<p class="Pp">The arguments are interpreted as binary or source package names.
    See the <b>--only-source</b> option if you want to change that.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>satisfy</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">satisfy causes apt-get to satisfy the given dependency
  strings. The dependency strings may have build profiles and architecture
  restriction list as in build dependencies. They may optionally be prefixed
  with &quot;Conflicts: &quot; to unsatisfy the dependency string. Multiple
  strings of the same type can be specified.
<p class="Pp">Example: apt-get satisfy &quot;foo&quot; &quot;Conflicts:
    bar&quot; &quot;baz (&gt;&gt; 1.0) | bar (= 2.0), moo&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">The legacy operator '&lt;/&gt;' is not supported, use
    '&lt;=/&gt;=' instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>check</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">check is a diagnostic tool; it updates the package cache
  and checks for broken dependencies.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>download</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">download will download the given binary package into the
  current directory. The authenticity of the package data is ensured as
  usual.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>clean</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">clean clears out the local repository of retrieved
  package files. It removes everything but the lock file from
  /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>autoclean</b> (and the <b>auto-clean</b> alias since 1.1)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of
  retrieved package files. The difference is that it only removes package files
  that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This allows a cache
  to be maintained over a long period without it growing out of control. The
  configuration option APT::Clean-Installed will prevent installed packages from
  being erased if it is set to off.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>distclean</b> (and the <b>dist-clean</b> alias)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">distclean removes all files under /var/lib/apt/lists
  except Release, Release.gpg, and InRelease. It can be used for example, when
  finalizing images distributed to users. The release files are kept for
  security reasons, to prevent various types of attacks.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>autoremove</b> (and the <b>auto-remove</b> alias since 1.1)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">autoremove is used to remove packages that were
  automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now
  no longer needed.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>autopurge</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like autoremove, but autopurge also removes configuration
  files. This is a shortcut for autoremove --purge.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>changelog</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">changelog tries to download the changelog of a package
  and displays it through <b>sensible-pager</b>. By default it displays the
  changelog for the version that is installed. However, you can specify the same
  options as for the <b>install</b> command.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>indextargets</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Displays by default a deb822 formatted listing of
  information about all data files (aka index targets) <b>apt-get update</b>
  would download. Supports a <b>--format</b> option to modify the output format
  as well as accepts lines of the default output to filter the records by. The
  command is mainly used as an interface for external tools working with APT to
  get information as well as filenames for downloaded files so they can use them
  as well instead of downloading them again on their own. Detailed documentation
  is omitted here and can instead be found in the file
  /usr/share/doc/apt/acquire-additional-files.md.gz shipped by the apt-doc
  package.</div>

<p class="Pp">All command line options may be set using the configuration file,
    the descriptions indicate the configuration option to set. For boolean
    options you can override the config file by using something like
    <b>-f-</b>,<b>--no-f</b>, <b>-f=no</b> or several other variations.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--no-install-recommends</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not consider recommended packages as a dependency for
  installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Recommends.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--install-suggests</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider suggested packages as a dependency for
  installing. Configuration Item: APT::Install-Suggests.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-d</b>, <b>--download-only</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Download only; package files are only retrieved, not
  unpacked or installed. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download-Only.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-f</b>, <b>--fix-broken</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies
  in place. This option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to
  permit APT to deduce a likely solution. If packages are specified, these have
  to completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when
  running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package
  dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's dependency
  structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually
  means using <b>dpkg --remove</b> to eliminate some of the offending packages).
  Use of this option together with <b>-m</b> may produce an error in some
  situations. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-m</b>, <b>--ignore-missing</b>, <b>--fix-missing</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore missing packages; if packages cannot be retrieved
  or fail the integrity check after retrieval (corrupted package files), hold
  back those packages and handle the result. Use of this option together with
  <b>-f</b> may produce an error in some situations. If a package is selected
  for installation (particularly if it is mentioned on the command line) and it
  could not be downloaded then it will be silently held back. Configuration
  Item: APT::Get::Fix-Missing.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--no-download</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disables downloading of packages. This is best used with
  <b>--ignore-missing</b> to force APT to use only the .debs it has already
  downloaded. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Download.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting
  progress indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2.
  You can also use <b>-q=#</b> to set the quiet level, overriding the
  configuration file. Note that quiet level 2 implies <b>-y</b>; you should
  never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as
  APT may decide to do something you did not expect. Configuration Item:
  quiet.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-s</b>, <b>--simulate</b>, <b>--just-print</b>,
    <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b>, <b>--no-act</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">No action; perform a simulation of events that would
  occur based on the current system state but do not actually change the system.
  Locking will be disabled (<b>Debug::NoLocking</b>) so the system state could
  change while <b>apt-get</b> is running. Simulations can also be executed by
  non-root users which might not have read access to all apt configuration
  distorting the simulation. A notice expressing this warning is also shown by
  default for non-root users (<b>APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note</b>).
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Simulate.
<p class="Pp">Simulated runs print out a series of lines, each representing a

  such as changing a held package, trying to install an unauthenticated package
  or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will abort. Configuration

<p class="Pp"><b>-a</b>, <b>--host-architecture</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option controls the architecture packages are built
  for by <b>apt-get source --compile</b> and how cross-builddependencies are
  satisfied. By default is it not set which means that the host architecture is
  the same as the build architecture (which is defined by APT::Architecture).
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Host-Architecture.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-P</b>, <b>--build-profiles</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option controls the activated build profiles for
  which a source package is built by <b>apt-get source --compile</b> and how
  build dependencies are satisfied. By default no build profile is active. More
  than one build profile can be activated at a time by concatenating them with a
  comma. Configuration Item: APT::Build-Profiles.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Compile source packages after downloading them.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Compile.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--ignore-hold</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore package holds; this causes <b>apt-get</b> to
  ignore a hold placed on a package. This may be useful in conjunction with
  dist-upgrade to override a large number of undesired holds. Configuration
  Item: APT::Ignore-Hold.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--with-new-pkgs</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow installing new packages when used in conjunction
  with upgrade. This is useful if the update of an installed package requires
  new dependencies to be installed. Instead of holding the package back upgrade
  will upgrade the package and install the new dependencies. Note that upgrade
  with this option will never remove packages, only allow adding new ones.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Upgrade-Allow-New.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--no-upgrade</b></p>

  string. This overrides the general settings in /etc/apt/preferences.
  Specifically pinned packages are not affected by the value of this option. In
  short, this option lets you have simple control over which distribution
  packages will be retrieved from. Some common examples might be <b>-t

  APT::Get::Tar-Only.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--arch-only</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only process architecture-dependent build-dependencies.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Arch-Only.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--indep-only</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only process architecture-independent build-dependencies.
  Configuration Item: APT::Get::Indep-Only.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--allow-unauthenticated</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and don't
  prompt about it. This can be useful while working with local repositories, but
  is a huge security risk if data authenticity isn't ensured in another way by
  the user itself. The usage of the <b>Trusted</b> option for
  <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries should usually be preferred over this global
  override. Configuration Item: APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--allow-insecure-repositories</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow the update command to acquire unverifiable data
  from configured sources. APT will otherwise fail at the update command for
  repositories without valid cryptographically signatures. See also
  <b>apt-secure</b>(8) for details on the concept and the implications.
  Configuration Item: Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--allow-releaseinfo-change</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow the update command to continue downloading data
  from a repository which changed its information of the release contained in
  the repository indicating e.g a new major release. APT will fail at the update
  command for such repositories until the change is confirmed to ensure the user
  is prepared for the change. See also <b>apt-secure</b>(8) for details on the
  concept and configuration.
<p class="Pp">Specialist options (--allow-releaseinfo-change-<i>field</i>) exist
    to allow changes only for certain fields like origin, label, codename,
    suite, version and defaultpin. See also <b>apt_preferences</b>(5).
    Configuration Item: Acquire::AllowReleaseInfoChange.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--show-progress</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show user friendly progress information in the terminal
  window when packages are installed, upgraded or removed. For a machine
  parsable version of this data see README.progress-reporting in the apt doc
  directory. Configuration Items: Dpkg::Progress and Dpkg::Progress-Fancy.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--with-source</b> <b></b><i>filename</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Adds the given file as a source for metadata. Can be
  repeated to add multiple files. See <b>--with-source</b> description in
  <b>apt-cache</b>(8) for further details.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-e</b><b></b><i>any</i>,
  <b>--error-on=</b><b></b><i>any</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fail the update command if any error occured, even a
  transient one.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-U</b>, <b>--update</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run the <b>update</b> command before the specified
  command. This is supported for commands installing, removing, or upgrading
  packages such as <b>install</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>safe-upgrade</b>,
  <b>full-upgrade</b>. This can be useful to ensure a command always installs
  the latest versions, or, in combination with the <b>--snapshot</b> option to
  make sure the snapshot is present when install is being run.
<p class="Pp">Caveat: Due to technical limitations, locks are acquired
    individually for each phase, hence an install may fail to acquire locks
    after successfully executing the update. Until this is resolved, this is
    merely syntactic sugar for apt update &amp;&amp; apt install</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a short usage summary.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the program version.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-c</b>, <b>--config-file</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use.
  The program will read the default configuration file and then this
  configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the
  default configuration files are parsed specify a file with the
  <b>APT_CONFIG</b> environment variable. See <b>apt.conf</b>(5) for syntax
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-o</b>, <b>--option</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary
  configuration option. The syntax is <b>-o Foo::Bar=bar</b>. <b>-o</b> and
  <b>--option</b> can be used multiple times to set different options.</div>
