<p class="Pp">The <b>e2image</b> program will save critical ext2, ext3, or ext4
    file system metadata located on <i>device</i> to a file specified by
    <i>image-file</i>. The image file may be examined by <b>dumpe2fs</b> and
    <b>debugfs</b>, by using the <b>-i</b> option to those programs. This can
    assist an expert in recovering catastrophically corrupted file systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is a very good idea to create image files for all file systems
    on a system and save the partition layout (which can be generated using the
    <b>fdisk -l</b> command) at regular intervals --- at boot time, and/or every
    week or so. The image file should be stored on some file system other than
    the file system whose data it contains, to ensure that this data is
    accessible in the case where the file system has been badly damaged.</p>
<p class="Pp">To save disk space, <b>e2image</b> creates the image file as a
    sparse file, or in QCOW2 format. Hence, if the sparse image file needs to be
    copied to another location, it should either be compressed first or copied
    using the <b>--sparse=always</b> option to the GNU version of <b>cp</b>(1).
    This does not apply to the QCOW2 image, which is not sparse.</p>
<p class="Pp">The size of an ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of
    the file systems and how many inodes are in use. For a typical 10 Gigabyte
    file system, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2 million inodes, the image
    file will be approximately 35 Megabytes; a 4 Gigabyte file system with
    15,000 inodes in use out of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3 Megabyte image
    file. Image files tend to be quite compressible; an image file taking up 32
    Megabytes of space on disk will generally compress down to 3 or 4
  Megabytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>image-file</i> is <b>-</b>, then the output of
    <b>e2image</b> will be sent to standard output, so that the output can be
    piped to another program, such as <b>gzip</b>(1). (Note that this is
    currently only supported when creating a raw image file using the <b>-r</b>
    option, since the process of creating a normal image file, or QCOW2 image
    currently requires random access to the file, which cannot be done using a
    pipe.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Include file data in the image file. Normally <b>e2image</b> only includes
      fs metadata, not regular file data. This option will produce an image that
      is suitable to use to clone the entire FS or for backup purposes. Note
      that this option only works with the raw (<i>-r</i>) or QCOW2 (<i>-Q</i>)
      formats. In conjunction with the <b>-r</b> option it is possible to clone
      all and only the used blocks of one file system to another device/image
      file.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b><i> superblock</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Get image from partition with broken primary superblock by using the
      superblock located at file system block number <i>superblock</i>. The
      partition is copied as-is including broken primary superblock.</dd>
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><b>-B</b><i> blocksize</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the file system blocksize in bytes. Normally, <b>e2image</b> will
      search for the superblock at various different block sizes in an attempt
      to find the appropriate blocksize. This search can be fooled in some
      cases. This option forces e2fsck to only try locating the superblock with
      a particular blocksize. If the superblock is not found, e2image will
      terminate with a fatal error.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Compare each block to be copied from the source <i>device</i> to the
      corresponding block in the target <i>image-file</i>. If both are already
      the same, the write will be skipped. This is useful if the file system is
      being cloned to a flash-based storage device (where reads are very fast
      and where it is desirable to avoid unnecessary writes to reduce write wear
      on the device).</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Override the read-only requirement for the source file system when saving
      the image file using the <b>-r</b> and <b>-Q</b> options. Normally, if the
      source file system is in use, the resulting image file is very likely not
      going to be useful. In some cases where the source file system is in
      constant use this may be better than no image at all.</dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I"><b>-I</b></a></dt>
  <dd>install the metadata stored in the image file back to the device. It can
      be used to restore the file system metadata back to the device in
      emergency situations.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING!!!!</b> The <b>-I</b> option should only be used as a
    desperation measure when other alternatives have failed. If the file system
    has changed since the image file was created, data <b>will</b> be lost. In
    general, you should make another full image backup of the file system first,
    in case you wish to try other recovery strategies afterward.</p>

  <dd>Scramble directory entries and zero out unused portions of the directory
      blocks in the written image file to avoid revealing information about the
      contents of the file system. However, this will prevent analysis of
      problems related to hash-tree indexed directories.

<h1 class="Sh" id="RAW_IMAGE_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#RAW_IMAGE_FILES">RAW
  IMAGE FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-r</b> option will create a raw image file, which differs
    from a normal image file in two ways. First, the file system metadata is
    placed in the same relative offset within <i>image-file</i> as it is in the
    <i>device</i> so that <b>debugfs</b>(8), <b>dumpe2fs</b>(8),
    <b>e2fsck</b>(8), <b>losetup</b>(8), etc. and can be run directly on the raw
    image file. In order to minimize the amount of disk space consumed by the
    raw image file, it is created as a sparse file. (Beware of copying or
    compressing/decompressing this file with utilities that don't understand how
    to create sparse files; the file will become as large as the file system
    itself!) Secondly, the raw image file also includes indirect blocks and
    directory blocks, which the standard image file does not have.</p>
<p class="Pp">Raw image files are sometimes used when sending file systems to
    the maintainer as part of bug reports to e2fsprogs. When used in this
    capacity, the recommended command is as follows (replace <b>hda1</b> with
    the appropriate device for your system):</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>e2image -r /dev/hda1 - | bzip2 &gt; hda1.e2i.bz2</b></p>
<p class="Pp">This will only send the metadata information, without any data
    blocks. However, the filenames in the directory blocks can still reveal
    information about the contents of the file system that the bug reporter may
    wish to keep confidential. To address this concern, the <b>-s</b> option can
    be specified to scramble the filenames in the image.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this will work even if you substitute <b>/dev/hda1</b>
    for another raw disk image, or QCOW2 image previously created by
    <b>e2image</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QCOW2_IMAGE_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#QCOW2_IMAGE_FILES">QCOW2
  IMAGE FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-Q</b> option will create a QCOW2 image file instead of a
    normal, or raw image file. A QCOW2 image contains all the information the
    raw image does, however unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2
    image minimize the amount of space used by the image by storing it in
    special format which packs data closely together, hence avoiding holes while
    still minimizing size.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to send file system to the maintainer as a part of bug
    report to e2fsprogs, use following commands (replace <b>hda1</b> with the
    appropriate device for your system):</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>e2image -Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2</b>
  <br/>
  	<b>bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2</b></p>
<p class="Pp">This will only send the metadata information, without any data
    blocks. As described for <b>RAW IMAGE FILES</b> the <b>-s</b> option can be
    specified to scramble the file system names in the image.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the QCOW2 image created by <b>e2image</b> is a regular
    QCOW2 image and can be processed by tools aware of QCOW2 format such as for
    example <b>qemu-img</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can convert a .qcow2 image into a raw image with:</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>e2image -r hda1.qcow2 hda1.raw</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<p class="Pp">This can be useful to write a QCOW2 image containing all data to a
    sparse image file where it can be loop mounted, or to a disk partition. Note
    that this may not work with QCOW2 images not generated by e2image.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OFFSETS"><a class="permalink" href="#OFFSETS">OFFSETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Normally a file system starts at the beginning of a partition, and
    <b>e2image</b> is run on the partition. When working with image files, you
    don't have the option of using the partition device, so you can specify the
    offset where the file system starts directly with the <b>-o</b> option.
    Similarly the <b>-O</b> option specifies the offset that should be seeked to
    in the destination before writing the file system.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have a <b>dd</b> image of a whole hard drive
    that contains an ext2 fs in a partition starting at 1 MiB, you can clone
    that image to a block device with:</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>e2image -aro 1048576 img /dev/sda1</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<p class="Pp">Or you can clone a file system from a block device into an image
    file, leaving room in the first MiB for a partition table with:</p>
<p class="Pp">	<b>e2image -arO 1048576 /dev/sda1 img</b>
  <br/>
</p>
<p class="Pp">If you specify at least one offset, and only one file, an in-place
    move will be performed, allowing you to safely move the file system from one
    offset to another.</p>
