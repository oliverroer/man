<p class="Pp"><b>apt</b> provides a high-level commandline interface for the
    package management system. It is intended as an end user interface and
    enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared
    to more specialized APT tools like <b>apt-get</b>(8) and
    <b>apt-cache</b>(8).</p>
<p class="Pp">Much like <b>apt</b> itself, its manpage is intended as an end
    user interface and as such only mentions the most used commands and options
    partly to not duplicate information in multiple places and partly to avoid
    overwhelming readers with a cornucopia of options and details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>update</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>update</b> is used to download package information
  from all configured sources. Other commands operate on this data to e.g.
  perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all packages
  available for installation.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>upgrade</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>upgrade</b> is used to install available upgrades of
  all packages currently installed on the system from the sources configured via
  <b>sources.list</b>(5). New packages will be installed if required to satisfy
  dependencies, but existing packages will never be removed. If an upgrade for a
  package requires the removal of an installed package the upgrade for this
  package isn't performed.
<p class="Pp">When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be
    installed prior to the upgrade action.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>full-upgrade</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will
  remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the system as
  a whole.
<p class="Pp">When a package is supplied as an argument, the package will be
    installed prior to the upgrade action.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>install</b>, <b>reinstall</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>purge</b>
    (<b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Performs the requested action on one or more packages
  specified via <b>regex</b>(7), <b>glob</b>(7) or exact match. The requested
  action can be overridden for specific packages by appending a plus (+) to the
  package name to install this package or a minus (-) to remove it.
<p class="Pp">A specific version of a package can be selected for installation
    by following the package name with an equals (=) and the version of the
    package to select. Alternatively the version from a specific release can be
    selected by following the package name with a forward slash (/) and codename
    (bookworm, trixie, sid ...) or suite name (stable, testing, unstable). This
    will also select versions from this release for dependencies of this package
    if needed to satisfy the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Removing a package removes all packaged data, but leaves usually
    small (modified) user configuration files behind, in case the remove was an
    accident. Just issuing an installation request for the accidentally removed
    package will restore its function as before in that case. On the other hand
    you can get rid of these leftovers by calling <b>purge</b> even on already
    removed packages. Note that this does not affect any data or configuration
    stored in your home directory.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>autoremove</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">autoremove is used to remove packages that were
  automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now
  no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing them were
  removed in the meantime.
<p class="Pp">You should check that the list does not include applications you
    have grown to like even though they were once installed just as a dependency
    of another package. You can mark such a package as manually installed by
    using <b>apt-mark</b>(8). Packages which you have installed explicitly via
    <b>install</b> are also never proposed for automatic removal.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>satisfy</b> (<b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>satisfy</b> satisfies dependency strings, as used in
  Build-Depends. It also handles conflicts, by prefixing an argument with
  &quot;Conflicts: &quot;.
<p class="Pp">Example: apt satisfy &quot;foo, bar (&gt;= 1.0)&quot;
    &quot;Conflicts: baz, fuzz&quot;</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>search</b> (<b>apt-cache</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>search</b> can be used to search for the given
  <b>regex</b>(7) term(s) in the list of available packages and display matches.
  This can e.g. be useful if you are looking for packages having a specific
  feature. If you are looking for a package including a specific file try
  <b>apt-file</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>show</b> (<b>apt-cache</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show information about the given package(s) including its
  dependencies, installation and download size, sources the package is available
  from, the description of the packages content and much more. It can e.g. be
  helpful to look at this information before allowing <b>apt</b>(8) to remove a
  package or while searching for new packages to install.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>list</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>list</b> is somewhat similar to <b>dpkg-query
  --list</b> in that it can display a list of packages satisfying certain
  criteria. It supports <b>glob</b>(7) patterns for matching package names,
  <b>apt-patterns</b>(7), as well as options to list installed
  (<b>--installed</b>), upgradeable (<b>--upgradeable</b>) or all available
  (<b>--all-versions</b>) versions.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>edit-sources</b> (work-in-progress)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">edit-sources lets you edit your <b>sources.list</b>(5)
  files in your preferred text editor while also providing basic sanity
  checks.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>showsrc, depends, rdepends, policy</b> (summarised in
    <b>apt-cache</b>(8))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<p class="Pp"><b>source, build-dep, download, changelog, clean, distclean,
    autoclean</b> (summarised in <b>apt-get</b>(8))</p>

  USAGE AND DIFFERENCES FROM OTHER APT TOOLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>apt</b>(8) commandline is designed as an end-user tool and
    it may change behavior between versions. While it tries not to break
    backward compatibility this is not guaranteed either if a change seems
    beneficial for interactive use.</p>
<p class="Pp">All features of <b>apt</b>(8) are available in dedicated APT tools
    like <b>apt-get</b>(8) and <b>apt-cache</b>(8) as well. <b>apt</b>(8) just
    changes the default value of some options (see <b>apt.conf</b>(5) and
    specifically the Binary scope). So you should prefer using these commands
    (potentially with some additional options enabled) in your scripts as they
    keep backward compatibility as much as possible.</p>
