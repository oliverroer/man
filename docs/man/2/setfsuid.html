<p class="Pp">On Linux, a process has both a filesystem user ID and an effective
    user ID. The (Linux-specific) filesystem user ID is used for permissions
    checking when accessing filesystem objects, while the effective user ID is
    used for various other kinds of permissions checks (see
    <b>credentials</b>(7)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the value of the process's filesystem user ID is the
    same as the value of its effective user ID. This is so, because whenever a
    process's effective user ID is changed, the kernel also changes the
    filesystem user ID to be the same as the new value of the effective user ID.
    A process can cause the value of its filesystem user ID to diverge from its
    effective user ID by using <b>setfsuid</b>() to change its filesystem user
    ID to the value given in <i>fsuid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Explicit calls to <b>setfsuid</b>() and <b>setfsgid</b>(2) are
    (were) usually used only by programs such as the Linux NFS server that need
    to change what user and group ID is used for file access without a
    corresponding change in the real and effective user and group IDs. A change
    in the normal user IDs for a program such as the NFS server is (was) a
    security hole that can expose it to unwanted signals. (However, this issue
    is historical; see below.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>setfsuid</b>() will succeed only if the caller is the superuser
    or if <i>fsuid</i> matches either the caller's real user ID, effective user
    ID, saved set-user-ID, or current filesystem user ID.</p>

<p class="Pp">Linux 1.2.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the time when this system call was introduced, one process
    could send a signal to another process with the same effective user ID. This
    meant that if a privileged process changed its effective user ID for the
    purpose of file permission checking, then it could become vulnerable to
    receiving signals sent by another (unprivileged) process with the same user
    ID. The filesystem user ID attribute was thus added to allow a process to
    change its user ID for the purposes of file permission checking without at
    the same time becoming vulnerable to receiving unwanted signals. Since Linux
    2.0, signal permission handling is different (see <b>kill</b>(2)), with the
    result that a process can change its effective user ID without being
    vulnerable to receiving signals from unwanted processes. Thus,
    <b>setfsuid</b>() is nowadays unneeded and should be avoided in new
    applications (likewise for <b>setfsgid</b>(2)).</p>
<p class="Pp">The original Linux <b>setfsuid</b>() system call supported only
    16-bit user IDs. Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added <b>setfsuid32</b>()
    supporting 32-bit IDs. The glibc <b>setfsuid</b>() wrapper function
    transparently deals with the variation across kernel versions.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="C_library/kernel_differences"><a class="permalink" href="#C_library/kernel_differences">C
  library/kernel differences</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In glibc 2.15 and earlier, when the wrapper for this system call
    determines that the argument can't be passed to the kernel without integer
    truncation (because the kernel is old and does not support 32-bit user IDs),
    it will return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to <b>EINVAL</b> without attempting
    the system call.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">No error indications of any kind are returned to the caller, and
    the fact that both successful and unsuccessful calls return the same value
    makes it impossible to directly determine whether the call succeeded or
    failed. Instead, the caller must resort to looking at the return value from
    a further call such as <i>setfsuid(-1)</i> (which will always fail), in
    order to determine if a preceding call to <b>setfsuid</b>() changed the
    filesystem user ID. At the very least, <b>EPERM</b> should be returned when
    the call fails (because the caller lacks the <b>CAP_SETUID</b>
  capability).</p>
