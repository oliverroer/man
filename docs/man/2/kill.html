<p class="Pp">The <b>kill</b>() system call can be used to send any signal to
    any process group or process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> is positive, then signal <i>sig</i> is sent to the
    process with the ID specified by <i>pid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> equals 0, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process
    in the process group of the calling process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> equals -1, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process
    for which the calling process has permission to send signals, except for
    process 1 (<i>init</i>), but see below.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> is less than -1, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every
    process in the process group whose ID is <i>-pid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>sig</i> is 0, then no signal is sent, but existence and
    permission checks are still performed; this can be used to check for the
    existence of a process ID or process group ID that the caller is permitted
    to signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a process to have permission to send a signal, it must either
    be privileged (under Linux: have the <b>CAP_KILL</b> capability in the user
    namespace of the target process), or the real or effective user ID of the
    sending process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the target
    process. In the case of <b>SIGCONT</b>, it suffices when the sending and
    receiving processes belong to the same session. (Historically, the rules
    were different; see NOTES.)</p>

<p class="Pp">Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different
    rules for the permissions required for an unprivileged process to send a
    signal to another process. In Linux 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if
    the effective user ID of the sender matched effective user ID of the target,
    or the real user ID of the sender matched the real user ID of the target.
    From Linux 1.2.3 until 1.3.77, a signal could be sent if the effective user
    ID of the sender matched either the real or effective user ID of the target.
    The current rules, which conform to POSIX.1, were adopted in Linux
  1.3.78.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1, the <i>init</i>
    process, are those for which <i>init</i> has explicitly installed signal
    handlers. This is done to assure the system is not brought down
    accidentally.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1 requires that <i>kill(-1,sig)</i> send <i>sig</i> to all
    processes that the calling process may send signals to, except possibly for
    some implementation-defined system processes. Linux allows a process to
    signal itself, but on Linux the call <i>kill(-1,sig)</i> does not signal the
    calling process.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1 requires that if a process sends a signal to itself, and
    the sending thread does not have the signal blocked, and no other thread has
    it unblocked or is waiting for it in <b>sigwait</b>(3), at least one
    unblocked signal must be delivered to the sending thread before the
    <b>kill</b>() returns.</p>

<p class="Pp">In Linux 2.6 up to and including Linux 2.6.7, there was a bug that
    meant that when sending signals to a process group, <b>kill</b>() failed
    with the error <b>EPERM</b> if the caller did not have permission to send
    the signal to <i>any</i> (rather than <i>all</i>) of the members of the
    process group. Notwithstanding this error return, the signal was still
    delivered to all of the processes for which the caller had permission to
    signal.</p>
