<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This manual is intended to offer a quick introduction to
    <b>Linux-PAM</b>. For more information the reader is directed to the
    <b>Linux-PAM system administrators' guide</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Linux-PAM</b> is a system of libraries that handle the
    authentication tasks of applications (services) on the system. The library
    provides a stable general interface (Application Programming Interface -
    API) that privilege granting programs (such as <b>login</b>(1) and
    <b>su</b>(1)) defer to to perform standard authentication tasks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The principal feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of
    the authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words, the system
    administrator is free to choose how individual service-providing
    applications will authenticate users. This dynamic configuration is set by
    the contents of the single <b>Linux-PAM</b> configuration file
    /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively and preferably, the configuration can be set by
    individual configuration files located in a pam.d directory. The presence of
    this directory will cause <b>Linux-PAM</b> to <i>ignore</i>
  /etc/pam.conf.</p>
<p class="Pp">Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the
    system directory /usr/lib/pam.d/ or a configurable vendor specific directory
    instead of the machine configuration directory /etc/pam.d/. If no machine
    configuration file is found, the vendor-supplied file is used. All files in
    /etc/pam.d/ override files with the same name in other directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">From the point of view of the system administrator, for whom this
    manual is provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the
    internal behavior of the <b>Linux-PAM</b> library. The important point to
    recognize is that the configuration file(s) <i>define</i> the connection
    between applications (<b>services</b>) and the pluggable authentication
    modules (<b>PAM</b>s) that perform the actual authentication tasks.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Linux-PAM</b> separates the tasks of <i>authentication</i> into
    four independent management groups: <b>account</b> management;
    <b>auth</b>entication management; <b>password</b> management; and
    <b>session</b> management. (We highlight the abbreviations used for these
    groups in the configuration file.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a
    typical user's request for a restricted service:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>account</b> - provide account verification types of service:
    has the user's password expired?; is this user permitted access to the
    requested service?</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>auth</b>entication - authenticate a user and set up user
    credentials. Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the
    user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your
    password. Not all authentications are of this type, there exist hardware
    based authentication schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric
    devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for
    more standard approaches to authentication - such is the flexibility of
    <b>Linux-PAM</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>password</b> - this group's responsibility is the task of
    updating authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly
    coupled to those of the <b>auth</b> group. Some authentication mechanisms
    lend themselves well to being updated with such a function. Standard UN*X
    password-based access is the obvious example: please enter a replacement
    password.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>session</b> - this group of tasks cover things that should be
    done prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks
    include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the user's home
    directory. The <b>session</b> management group is important as it provides
    both an opening and closing hook for modules to affect the services
    available to a user.</p>
