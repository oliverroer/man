<p class="Pp">The persistent keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf
    of a user. Each UID the kernel deals with has its own persistent keyring
    that is shared between all threads owned by that UID. The persistent keyring
    has a name (description) of the form <i>_persistent.&lt;UID&gt;</i> where
    <i>&lt;UID&gt;</i> is the user ID of the corresponding user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The persistent keyring may not be accessed directly, even by
    processes with the appropriate UID. Instead, it must first be linked to one
    of a process's keyrings, before that keyring can access the persistent
    keyring by virtue of its possessor permits. This linking is done with the
    <b>keyctl_get_persistent</b>(3) function.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a persistent keyring does not exist when it is accessed by the
    <b>keyctl_get_persistent</b>(3) operation, it will be automatically
  created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each time the <b>keyctl_get_persistent</b>(3) operation is
    performed, the persistent keyring's expiration timer is reset to the value
    in:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>/proc/sys/kernel/keys/persistent_keyring_expiry
</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Should the timeout be reached, the persistent keyring will be
    removed and everything it pins can then be garbage collected. The keyring
    will then be re-created on a subsequent call to
    <b>keyctl_get_persistent</b>(3).</p>
<p class="Pp">The persistent keyring is not directly searched by
    <b>request_key</b>(2); it is searched only if it is linked into one of the
    keyrings that is searched by <b>request_key</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">The persistent keyring is independent of <b>clone</b>(2),
    <b>fork</b>(2), <b>vfork</b>(2), <b>execve</b>(2), and <b>_exit</b>(2). It
    persists until its expiration timer triggers, at which point it is garbage
    collected. This allows the persistent keyring to carry keys beyond the life
    of the kernel's record of the corresponding UID (the destruction of which
    results in the destruction of the <b>user-keyring</b>(7) and the
    <b>user-session-keyring</b>(7)). The persistent keyring can thus be used to
    hold authentication tokens for processes that run without user interaction,
    such as programs started by <b>cron</b>(8).</p>
<p class="Pp">The persistent keyring is used to store UID-specific objects that
    themselves have limited lifetimes (e.g., kerberos tokens). If those tokens
    cease to be used (i.e., the persistent keyring is not accessed), then the
    timeout of the persistent keyring ensures that the corresponding objects are
    automatically discarded.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>keyutils</i> library provides the
    <b>keyctl_get_persistent</b>(3) function for manipulating persistent
    keyrings. (This function is an interface to the <b>keyctl</b>(2)
    <b>KEYCTL_GET_PERSISTENT</b> operation.) This operation allows the calling
    thread to get the persistent keyring corresponding to its own UID or, if the
    thread has the <b>CAP_SETUID</b> capability, the persistent keyring
    corresponding to some other UID in the same user namespace.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each user namespace owns a keyring called
    <i>.persistent_register</i> that contains links to all of the persistent
    keys in that namespace. (The <i>.persistent_register</i> keyring can be seen
    when reading the contents of the <i>/proc/keys</i> file for the UID 0 in the
    namespace.) The <b>keyctl_get_persistent</b>(3) operation looks for a key
    with a name of the form <i>_persistent.</i>UID in that keyring, creates the
    key if it does not exist, and links it into the keyring.</p>
