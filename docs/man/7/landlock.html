</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Landlock is an access-control system that enables any processes to
    securely restrict themselves and their future children. Because Landlock is
    a stackable Linux Security Module (LSM), it makes it possible to create safe
    security sandboxes as new security layers in addition to the existing
    system-wide access-controls. This kind of sandbox is expected to help
    mitigate the security impact of bugs, and unexpected or malicious behaviors
    in applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">A Landlock security policy is a set of access rights (e.g., open a
    file in read-only, make a directory, etc.) tied to a file hierarchy. Such
    policy can be configured and enforced by processes for themselves using
    three system calls:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><b>landlock_create_ruleset</b>(2) creates a new ruleset;</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><b>landlock_add_rule</b>(2) adds a new rule to a ruleset;</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><b>landlock_restrict_self</b>(2) enforces a ruleset on the calling
    thread.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To be able to use these system calls, the running kernel must
    support Landlock and it must be enabled at boot time.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Landlock_rules"><a class="permalink" href="#Landlock_rules">Landlock
  rules</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A Landlock rule describes an action on an object. An object is
    currently a file hierarchy, and the related filesystem actions are defined
    with access rights (see <b>landlock_add_rule</b>(2)). A set of rules is
    aggregated in a ruleset, which can then restrict the thread enforcing it,
    and its future children.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filesystem_actions"><a class="permalink" href="#Filesystem_actions">Filesystem
  actions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">These flags enable to restrict a sandboxed process to a set of
    actions on files and directories. Files or directories opened before the
    sandboxing are not subject to these restrictions. See
    <b>landlock_add_rule</b>(2) and <b>landlock_create_ruleset</b>(2) for more
    context.</p>
<p class="Pp">A file can only receive these access rights:</p>

      <b>open</b>(2), in the same way as read and write permissions are checked
      during <b>open</b>(2) using <b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE</b> and

<h2 class="Ss" id="Layers_of_file_path_access_rights"><a class="permalink" href="#Layers_of_file_path_access_rights">Layers
  of file path access rights</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each time a thread enforces a ruleset on itself, it updates its
    Landlock domain with a new layer of policy. Indeed, this complementary
    policy is composed with the potentially other rulesets already restricting
    this thread. A sandboxed thread can then safely add more constraints to
    itself with a new enforced ruleset.</p>
<p class="Pp">One policy layer grants access to a file path if at least one of
    its rules encountered on the path grants the access. A sandboxed thread can
    only access a file path if all its enforced policy layers grant the access
    as well as all the other system access controls (e.g., filesystem DAC, other
    LSM policies, etc.).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bind_mounts_and_OverlayFS"><a class="permalink" href="#Bind_mounts_and_OverlayFS">Bind
  mounts and OverlayFS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Landlock enables restricting access to file hierarchies, which
    means that these access rights can be propagated with bind mounts (cf.
    <b>mount_namespaces</b>(7)) but not with OverlayFS.</p>
<p class="Pp">A bind mount mirrors a source file hierarchy to a destination. The
    destination hierarchy is then composed of the exact same files, on which
    Landlock rules can be tied, either via the source or the destination path.
    These rules restrict access when they are encountered on a path, which means
    that they can restrict access to multiple file hierarchies at the same time,
    whether these hierarchies are the result of bind mounts or not.</p>
<p class="Pp">An OverlayFS mount point consists of upper and lower layers. These
    layers are combined in a merge directory, result of the mount point. This
    merge hierarchy may include files from the upper and lower layers, but
    modifications performed on the merge hierarchy only reflect on the upper
    layer. From a Landlock policy point of view, each of the OverlayFS layers
    and merge hierarchies is standalone and contains its own set of files and
    directories, which is different from a bind mount. A policy restricting an
    OverlayFS layer will not restrict the resulted merged hierarchy, and vice
    versa. Landlock users should then only think about file hierarchies they
    want to allow access to, regardless of the underlying filesystem.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Inheritance"><a class="permalink" href="#Inheritance">Inheritance</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Every new thread resulting from a <b>clone</b>(2) inherits
    Landlock domain restrictions from its parent. This is similar to the
    <b>seccomp</b>(2) inheritance or any other LSM dealing with tasks'
    <b>credentials</b>(7). For instance, one process's thread may apply Landlock
    rules to itself, but they will not be automatically applied to other sibling
    threads (unlike POSIX thread credential changes, cf. <b>nptl</b>(7)).</p>
<p class="Pp">When a thread sandboxes itself, we have the guarantee that the
    related security policy will stay enforced on all this thread's descendants.
    This allows creating standalone and modular security policies per
    application, which will automatically be composed between themselves
    according to their run-time parent policies.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Ptrace_restrictions"><a class="permalink" href="#Ptrace_restrictions">Ptrace
  restrictions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A sandboxed process has less privileges than a non-sandboxed
    process and must then be subject to additional restrictions when
    manipulating another process. To be allowed to use <b>ptrace</b>(2) and
    related syscalls on a target process, a sandboxed process should have a
    subset of the target process rules, which means the tracee must be in a
    sub-domain of the tracer.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Truncating_files"><a class="permalink" href="#Truncating_files">Truncating
  files</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The operations covered by <b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</b> and
    <b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE</b> both change the contents of a file and
    sometimes overlap in non-intuitive ways. It is recommended to always specify
    both of these together.</p>
<p class="Pp">A particularly surprising example is <b>creat</b>(2). The name
    suggests that this system call requires the rights to create and write
    files. However, it also requires the truncate right if an existing file
    under the same name is already present.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should also be noted that truncating files does not require the
    <b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</b> right. Apart from the
    <b>truncate</b>(2) system call, this can also be done through <b>open</b>(2)
    with the flags <i>O_RDONLY&#x00A0;|&#x00A0;O_TRUNC</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When opening a file, the availability of the
    <b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE</b> right is associated with the newly
    created file descriptor and will be used for subsequent truncation attempts
    using <b>ftruncate</b>(2). The behavior is similar to opening a file for
    reading or writing, where permissions are checked during <b>open</b>(2), but
    not during the subsequent <b>read</b>(2) and <b>write</b>(2) calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a consequence, it is possible to have multiple open file
    descriptors for the same file, where one grants the right to truncate the
    file and the other does not. It is also possible to pass such file
    descriptors between processes, keeping their Landlock properties, even when
    these processes do not have an enforced Landlock ruleset.</p>

<p class="Pp">Users should use the Landlock ABI version rather than the kernel
    version to determine which features are available. The mainline kernel
    versions listed here are only included for orientation. Kernels from other
    sources may contain backported features, and their version numbers may not

    reparenting is not possible in a process restricted with Landlock ABI

<p class="Pp">In this example, the rule will only allow reading the file
