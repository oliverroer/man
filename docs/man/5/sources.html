<p class="Pp">sources.list - List of configured APT data sources</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The source list /etc/apt/sources.list and the files contained in
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ are designed to support any number of active
    sources and a variety of source media. The files list one source per line
    (one-line style) or contain multiline stanzas defining one or more sources
    per stanza (deb822 style), with the most preferred source listed first (in
    case a single version is available from more than one source). The
    information available from the configured sources is acquired by <b>apt-get
    update</b> (or by an equivalent command from another APT front-end).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SOURCES"><a class="permalink" href="#SOURCES">SOURCES.LIST.D</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add
    sources.list entries in separate files. Two different file formats are
    allowed as described in the next two sections. Filenames need to have either
    the extension .list or .sources depending on the contained format. The
    filenames may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore
    (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice
    that it has ignored a file, unless that file matches a pattern in the
    Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in which case it will be
    silently ignored.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ONE"><a class="permalink" href="#ONE">ONE-LINE-STYLE
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Files in this format have the extension .list. Each line
    specifying a source starts with a type (e.g. deb-src) followed by options
    and arguments for this type. Individual entries cannot be continued onto a
    following line. Empty lines are ignored, and a # character anywhere on a
    line marks the remainder of that line as a comment. Consequently an entry
    can be disabled by commenting out the entire line. If options should be
    provided they are separated by spaces and all of them together are enclosed
    by square brackets ([]) included in the line after the type separated from
    it with a space. If an option allows multiple values these are separated
    from each other with a comma (,). An option name is separated from its
    value(s) by an equals sign (=). Multivalue options also have -= and += as
    separators, which instead of replacing the default with the given value(s)
    modify the default value(s) to remove or include the given values.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the traditional format and supported by all apt versions.
    Note that not all options as described below are supported by all apt
    versions. Note also that some older applications parsing this format on
    their own might not expect to encounter options as they were uncommon before
    the introduction of multi-architecture support.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEB822"><a class="permalink" href="#DEB822">DEB822-STYLE
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Files in this format have the extension .sources. The format is
    similar in syntax to other files used by Debian and its derivatives, such as
    the metadata files that apt will download from the configured sources or the
    debian/control file in a Debian source package. Individual entries are
    separated by an empty line; additional empty lines are ignored, and a #
    character at the start of the line marks the entire line as a comment. An
    entry can hence be disabled by commenting out each line belonging to the
    stanza, but it is usually easier to add the field &quot;Enabled: no&quot; to
    the stanza to disable the entry. Removing the field or setting it to yes
    re-enables it. Options have the same syntax as every other field: A field
    name separated by a colon (:) and optionally spaces from its value(s). Note
    especially that multiple values are separated by whitespaces (like spaces,
    tabs and newlines), not by commas as in the one-line format. Multivalue
    fields like Architectures also have Architectures-Add and
    Architectures-Remove to modify the default value rather than replacing
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a new format supported by apt itself since version 1.1.
    Previous versions ignore such files with a notice message as described
    earlier. It is intended to make this format gradually the default format,
    deprecating the previously described one-line-style format, as it is easier
    to create, extend and modify for humans and machines alike especially if a
    lot of sources and/or options are involved. Developers who are working with
    and/or parsing apt sources are highly encouraged to add support for this
    format and to contact the APT team to coordinate and share this work. Users
    can freely adopt this format already, but may encounter problems with
    software not supporting the format yet.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: GENERAL FORMAT</h1>
<p class="Pp">The deb type references a typical two-level Debian archive,
    distribution/component. The distribution is generally a suite name like
    stable or testing or a codename like bookworm or trixie while component is
    one of main, contrib, non-free or non-free-firmware. The deb-src type
    references a Debian distribution's source code in the same form as the deb
    type. A deb-src line is required to fetch source indexes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The format for two one-line-style entries using the deb and
    deb-src types is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deb [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]
deb-src [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively the equivalent entry in deb822 style looks like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
     Types: deb deb-src
<br/>
     URIs: uri
<br/>
     Suites: suite
<br/>
     Components: [component1] [component2] [...]
<br/>
     option1: value1
<br/>
     option2: value2
<br/>
   </pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian
    distribution, from which APT will find the information it needs. suite can
    specify an exact path, in which case the components must be omitted and
    suite must end with a slash (/). This is useful for the case when only a
    particular sub-directory of the archive denoted by the URI is of interest.
    If suite does not specify an exact path, at least one component must be
    present.</p>
<p class="Pp">suite may also contain a variable, $(ARCH) which expands to the
    Debian architecture (such as amd64 or armel) used on the system. This
    permits architecture-independent sources.list files to be used. In general
    this is only of interest when specifying an exact path; APT will
    automatically generate a URI with the current architecture otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Especially in the one-line-style format since only one
    distribution can be specified per line it may be necessary to have multiple
    lines for the same URI, if a subset of all available distributions or
    components at that location is desired. APT will sort the URI list after it
    has generated a complete set internally, and will collapse multiple
    references to the same Internet host, for instance, into a single
    connection, so that it does not inefficiently establish a connection, close
    it, do something else, and then re-establish a connection to that same host.
    APT also parallelizes connections to different hosts to more effectively
    deal with sites with low bandwidth.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is important to list sources in order of preference, with the
    most preferred source listed first. Typically this will result in sorting by
    speed from fastest to slowest (CD-ROM followed by hosts on a local network,
    followed by distant Internet hosts, for example).</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, the sources for your distribution could look like
    this in one-line-style format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lunar main restricted
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lunar-security main restricted
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu lunar-updates main restricted</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">or like this in deb822 style format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Types: deb
URIs: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
Suites: lunar lunar-updates
Components: main restricted
Types: deb
URIs: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
Suites: lunar-security
Components: main restricted</pre>

<h1 class="Sh">THE DEB AND DEB-SRC TYPES: OPTIONS</h1>
<p class="Pp">Each source entry can have options specified to modify which
    source is accessed and how data is acquired from it. Format, syntax and
    names of the options vary between the one-line-style and deb822-style
    formats as described, but they both have the same options available. For
    simplicity we list the deb822 field name and provide the one-line name in
    brackets. Remember that besides setting multivalue options explicitly, there
    is also the option to modify them based on the default, but we aren't
    listing those names explicitly here. Unsupported options are silently
    ignored by all APT versions.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Architectures</b> (<b>arch</b>) is a
  multivalue option defining for which architectures information should be
  downloaded. If this option isn't set the default is all architectures as
  defined by the <b>APT::Architectures</b> config option.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Languages</b> (<b>lang</b>) is a multivalue
  option defining for which languages information such as translated package
  descriptions should be downloaded. If this option isn't set the default is all
  languages as defined by the <b>Acquire::Languages</b> config option.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Targets</b> (<b>target</b>) is a multivalue
  option defining which download targets apt will try to acquire from this
  source. If not specified, the default set is defined by the
  <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> configuration scope (targets are specified by
  their name in the Created-By field). Additionally, targets can be enabled or
  disabled by using the Identifier field as an option with a boolean value
  instead of using this multivalue option.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>PDiffs</b> (<b>pdiffs</b>) is a yes/no value
  which controls if APT should try to use PDiffs to update old indexes instead
  of downloading the new indexes entirely. The value of this option is ignored
  if the repository doesn't announce the availability of PDiffs. Defaults to the
  value of the option with the same name for a specific index file defined in
  the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> scope, which itself defaults to the value of
  configuration option <b>Acquire::PDiffs</b> which defaults to yes.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>By-Hash</b> (<b>by-hash</b>) can have the
  value yes, no or force and controls if APT should try to acquire indexes via a
  URI constructed from a hashsum of the expected file instead of using the
  well-known stable filename of the index. Using this can avoid hashsum
  mismatches, but requires a supporting mirror. A yes or no value
  activates/disables the use of this feature if this source indicates support
  for it, while force will enable the feature regardless of what the source
  indicates. Defaults to the value of the option of the same name for a specific
  index file defined in the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> scope, which itself
  defaults to the value of configuration option <b>Acquire::By-Hash</b> which
  defaults to yes.</div>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, there are options which if set affect <i>all</i>
    sources with the same URI and Suite, so they have to be set on all such
    entries and can not be varied between different components. APT will try to
    detect and error out on such anomalies.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Allow-Insecure</b> (<b>allow-insecure</b>),
  <b>Allow-Weak</b> (<b>allow-weak</b>) and <b>Allow-Downgrade-To-Insecure</b>
  (<b>allow-downgrade-to-insecure</b>) are boolean values which all default to
  no. If set to yes they circumvent parts of <b>apt-secure</b>(8) and should
  therefore not be used lightly!</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Trusted</b> (<b>trusted</b>) is a tri-state
  value which defaults to APT deciding if a source is considered trusted or if
  warnings should be raised before e.g. packages are installed from this source.
  This option can be used to override that decision. The value yes tells APT
  always to consider this source as trusted, even if it doesn't pass
  authentication checks. It disables parts of <b>apt-secure</b>(8), and should
  therefore only be used in a local and trusted context (if at all) as otherwise
  security is breached. The value no does the opposite, causing the source to be
  handled as untrusted even if the authentication checks passed successfully.
  The default value can't be set explicitly.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Signed-By</b> (<b>signed-by</b>) is an option
  to require a repository to pass <b>apt-secure</b>(8) verification with a
  certain set of keys rather than all trusted keys apt has configured. It is
  specified as a list of absolute paths to keyring files (have to be accessible
  and readable for the _apt system user, so ensure everyone has read-permissions
  on the file) and fingerprints of keys to select from these keyrings. The
  recommended locations for keyrings are /usr/share/keyrings for keyrings
  managed by packages, and /etc/apt/keyrings for keyrings managed by the system
  operator. If no keyring files are specified the default is the trusted.gpg
  keyring and all keyrings in the trusted.gpg.d/ directory (see <b>apt-key
  fingerprint</b>). If no fingerprint is specified all keys in the keyrings are
  selected. A fingerprint will accept also all signatures by a subkey of this
  key, if this isn't desired an exclamation mark (!) can be appended to the
  fingerprint to disable this behaviour. The option defaults to the value of the
  option with the same name if set in the previously acquired Release file of
  this repository (only fingerprints can be specified there through). Otherwise
  all keys in the trusted keyrings are considered valid signers for this
  repository. The option may also be set directly to an embedded GPG public key
  block. Special care is needed to encode the empty line with leading spaces and
  &quot;.&quot;:

<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Check-Valid-Until</b>
  (<b>check-valid-until</b>) is a yes/no value which controls if APT should try
  to detect replay attacks. A repository creator can declare a time until which
  the data provided in the repository should be considered valid, and if this
  time is reached, but no new data is provided, the data is considered expired
  and an error is raised. Besides increasing security, as a malicious attacker
  can't send old data forever to prevent a user from upgrading to a new version,
  this also helps users identify mirrors which are no longer updated. However,
  some repositories such as historic archives are not updated any more by
  design, so this check can be disabled by setting this option to no. Defaults
  to the value of configuration option <b>Acquire::Check-Valid-Until</b> which
  itself defaults to yes.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Valid-Until-Min</b> (<b>valid-until-min</b>)
  and <b>Valid-Until-Max</b> (<b>valid-until-max</b>) can be used to raise or
  lower the time period in seconds in which the data from this repository is
  considered valid. -Max can be especially useful if the repository provides no
  Valid-Until field on its Release file to set your own value, while -Min can be
  used to increase the valid time on seldom updated (local) mirrors of a more
  frequently updated but less accessible archive (which is in the sources.list
  as well) instead of disabling the check entirely. Default to the value of the
  configuration options <b>Acquire::Min-ValidTime</b> and
  <b>Acquire::Max-ValidTime</b> which are both unset by default.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Check-Date</b> (<b>check-date</b>) is a yes/no
  value which controls if APT should consider the machine's time correct and
  hence perform time related checks, such as verifying that a Release file is
  not from the future. Disabling it also disables the <b>Check-Valid-Until</b>
  option mentioned above.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Date-Max-Future</b> (<b>date-max-future</b>)
  controls how far from the future a repository may be. Default to the value of
  the configuration option <b>Acquire::Max-FutureTime</b> which is 10 seconds by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>InRelease-Path</b> (<b>inrelease-path</b>)
  determines the path to the InRelease file, relative to the normal position of
  an InRelease file. By default, this option is unset and APT will try to fetch
  an InRelease or, if that fails, a Release file and its associated Release.gpg
  file. By setting this option, the specified path will be tried instead of the
  InRelease file, and the fallback to Release files will be disabled.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Snapshot</b> (<b>snapshot</b>) allows
  selecting an earlier version of the archive from the snapshot service.
  Supported values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;enable to allow selecting a snapshot with the

<h1 class="Sh" id="URI_SPECIFICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#URI_SPECIFICATION">URI
  SPECIFICATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The currently recognized URI types are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>http</b> (<b>apt-transport-http</b>(1))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The http scheme specifies an HTTP server for an archive
  and is the most commonly used method. The URI can directly include login
  information if the archive requires it, but the use of <b>apt_auth.conf</b>(5)
  should be preferred. The method also supports SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) proxies
  either configured via apt-specific configuration or specified by the
  environment variable <b>http_proxy</b> in the format (assuming an HTTP proxy
  requiring authentication) <i>http://user:pass@server:port/</i>. The
  authentication details for proxies can also be supplied via
  <b>apt_auth.conf</b>(5).
<p class="Pp">Note that these forms of authentication are insecure as the whole
    communication with the remote server (or proxy) is not encrypted so a
    sufficiently capable attacker can observe and record login as well as all
    other interactions. The attacker can <i>not</i> modify the communication
    through as APT's data security model is independent of the chosen transport
    method. See <b>apt-secure</b>(8) for details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>https</b> (<b>apt-transport-https</b>(1))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The https scheme specifies an HTTPS server for an archive
  and is very similar in use and available options to the http scheme. The main
  difference is that the communication between apt and server (or proxy) is
  encrypted. Note that the encryption does not prevent an attacker from knowing
  which server (or proxy) apt is communicating with and deeper analysis can
  potentially still reveal which data was downloaded. If this is a concern the
  Tor-based schemes mentioned further below might be a suitable
  alternative.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>mirror</b>, <b>mirror+</b><b></b><i>scheme</i>
    (<b>apt-transport-mirror</b>(1))</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The mirror scheme specifies the location of a mirrorlist.
  By default the scheme used for the location is http, but any other scheme can
  be used via <b>mirror+</b><b></b><i>scheme</i>. The mirrorlist itself can
  contain many different URIs for mirrors the APT client can transparently pick,
  choose and fallback between intended to help both with distributing the load
  over the available mirrors and ensuring that clients can acquire data even if
  some configured mirrors are not available.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>file</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The file scheme allows an arbitrary directory in the file
  system to be considered an archive. This is useful for NFS mounts and local
  mirrors or archives.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cdrom</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The cdrom scheme allows APT to use a local CD-ROM, DVD or
  USB drive with media swapping. Use the <b>apt-cdrom</b>(8) program to create
  cdrom entries in the source list.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>ftp</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The ftp scheme specifies an FTP server for an archive.
  Use of FTP is on the decline in favour of http and https and many archives
  either never offered or are retiring FTP access. If you still need this method
  many configuration options for it are available in the Acquire::ftp scope and
  detailed in <b>apt.conf</b>(5).
<p class="Pp">Please note that an FTP proxy can be specified by using the
    <b>ftp_proxy</b> environment variable. It is possible to specify an HTTP
    proxy (HTTP proxy servers often understand FTP URLs) using this environment
    variable and <i>only</i> this environment variable. Proxies using HTTP
    specified in the configuration file will be ignored.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>copy</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The copy scheme is identical to the file scheme except
  that packages are copied into the cache directory instead of used directly at
  their location. This is useful for people using removable media to copy files
  around with APT.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>rsh</b>, <b>ssh</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The rsh/ssh method invokes RSH/SSH to connect to a remote
  host and access the files as a given user. Prior configuration of rhosts or
  RSA keys is recommended. The standard <b>find</b> and <b>dd</b> commands are
  used to perform the file transfers from the remote host.</div>
<p class="Pp">adding more recognizable URI types</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">APT can be extended with more methods shipped in other
  optional packages, which should follow the naming scheme
  apt-transport-<i>method</i>. For instance, the APT team also maintains the
  package apt-transport-tor, which provides access methods for HTTP and HTTPS
  URIs routed via the Tor network.</div>
