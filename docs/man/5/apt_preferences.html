<p class="Pp">apt_preferences - Preference control file for APT</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The APT preferences file /etc/apt/preferences and the fragment
    files in the /etc/apt/preferences.d/ folder can be used to control which
    versions of packages will be selected for installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several versions of a package may be available for installation
    when the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file contains references to more than one
    distribution (for example, stable and testing). APT assigns a priority to
    each version that is available. Subject to dependency constraints,
    <b>apt-get</b> selects the version with the highest priority for
    installation. The APT preferences override the priorities that APT assigns
    to package versions by default, thus giving the user control over which one
    is selected for installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several instances of the same version of a package may be
    available when the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file contains references to more
    than one source. In this case <b>apt-get</b> downloads the instance listed
    earliest in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file. The APT preferences do not
    affect the choice of instance, only the choice of version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Preferences are a strong power in the hands of a system
    administrator but they can become also their biggest nightmare if used
    without care! APT will not question the preferences, so wrong settings can
    lead to uninstallable packages or wrong decisions while upgrading packages.
    Even more problems will arise if multiple distribution releases are mixed
    without a good understanding of the following paragraphs. Packages included
    in a specific release aren't tested in (and therefore don't always work as
    expected in) older or newer releases, or together with other packages from
    different releases. You have been warned.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the files in the /etc/apt/preferences.d directory are
    parsed in alphanumeric ascending order and need to obey the following naming
    convention: The files have either no or &quot;pref&quot; as filename
    extension and only contain alphanumeric, hyphen (-), underscore (_) and
    period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored
    a file, unless that file matches a pattern in the Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently
    configuration list - in which case it will be silently ignored.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="APT"><a class="permalink" href="#APT">APT's Default Priority
  Assignments</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If there is no preferences file or if there is no entry in the
    file that applies to a particular version then the priority assigned to that
    version is the priority of the distribution to which that version belongs.
    It is possible to single out a distribution, &quot;the target release&quot;,
    which receives a higher priority than other distributions do by default. The
    target release can be set on the <b>apt-get</b> command line or in the APT
    configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf. Note that this has precedence over any
    general priority you set in the /etc/apt/preferences file described later,
    but not over specifically pinned packages. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>apt-get install -t testing </b><b></b><i>some-package</i></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>APT::Default-Release &quot;stable&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the target release has been specified then APT uses the
    following algorithm to set the priorities of the versions of a package.
    Assign:</p>
<p class="Pp">priority 1</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">to the versions coming from archives which in their
  Release files are marked as &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; but <i>not</i> as
  &quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot; like the Debian experimental archive, as
  well as versions that are not phased on this systems.</div>
<p class="Pp">priority 100</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">to the version that is already installed (if any) and to
  the versions coming from archives which in their Release files are marked as
  &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; and &quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot; like
  the Debian backports archive since squeeze-backports.</div>
<p class="Pp">priority 500</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">to the versions that do not belong to the target
  release.</div>
<p class="Pp">priority 990</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">to the versions that belong to the target release.</div>
The highest of those priorities whose description matches the version is
  assigned to the version.
<p class="Pp">If the target release has not been specified then APT simply
    assigns priority 100 to all installed package versions and priority 500 to
    all uninstalled package versions, except versions coming from archives which
    in their Release files are marked as &quot;NotAutomatic: yes&quot; - these
    versions get the priority 1 or priority 100 if it is additionally marked as
    &quot;ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">APT then applies the following rules, listed in order of
    precedence, to determine which version of a package to install.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Never downgrade unless the priority of an
  available version exceeds 1000. (&quot;Downgrading&quot; is installing a less
  recent version of a package in place of a more recent version. Note that none
  of APT's default priorities exceeds 1000; such high priorities can only be set
  in the preferences file. Note also that downgrading a package can be
  risky.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Install the highest priority version.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If two or more versions have the same priority,
  install the most recent one (that is, the one with the higher version
  number).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If two or more versions have the same priority
  and version number but either the packages differ in some of their metadata or
  the --reinstall option is given, install the uninstalled one.</div>
<p class="Pp">In a typical situation, the installed version of a package
    (priority 100) is not as recent as one of the versions available from the
    sources listed in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file (priority 500 or 990).
    Then the package will be upgraded when <b>apt-get install
    </b><b></b><i>some-package</i> or <b>apt-get upgrade</b> is executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">More rarely, the installed version of a package is <i>more</i>
    recent than any of the other available versions. The package will not be
    downgraded when <b>apt-get install </b><b></b><i>some-package</i> or
    <b>apt-get upgrade</b> is executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes the installed version of a package is more recent than
    the version belonging to the target release, but not as recent as a version
    belonging to some other distribution. Such a package will indeed be upgraded
    when <b>apt-get install </b><b></b><i>some-package</i> or <b>apt-get
    upgrade</b> is executed, because at least <i>one</i> of the available
    versions has a higher priority than the installed version.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Phased_Updates"><a class="permalink" href="#Phased_Updates">Phased
  Updates</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">APT understands a field called Phased-Update-Percentage which can
    be used to control the rollout of a new version. It is an integer between 0
    and 100.</p>
<p class="Pp">A system's eligibility to a phased update is determined by seeding
    random number generator with the package source name, the version number,
    and /etc/machine-id, and then calculating an integer in the range [0, 100].
    If this integer is larger than the Phased-Update-Percentage, the version is
    pinned to 1, and thus held back. Otherwise, normal policy rules apply.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case you have multiple systems that you want to receive the
    same set of updates, you can set APT::Machine-ID to a UUID such that they
    all phase the same, or set APT::Get::Never-Include-Phased-Updates or
    APT::Get::Always-Include-Phased-Updates to true such that APT will
    never/always consider phased updates.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Effect_of_APT_Preferences"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Effect_of_APT_Preferences">The
  Effect of APT Preferences</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The APT preferences file allows the system administrator to
    control the assignment of priorities. The file consists of one or more
    multi-line records separated by blank lines. Records can have one of two
    forms, a specific form and a general form.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The specific form assigns a priority (a
  &quot;Pin-Priority&quot;) to one or more specified packages with a specified
  version or version range. For example, the following record assigns a high
  priority to all versions of the perl package whose version number begins with
  &quot;5.32&quot;. Multiple packages can be separated by spaces.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: perl
Pin: version 5.32*
Pin-Priority: 1001</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The general form assigns a priority to all of the
  package versions in a given distribution (that is, to all the versions of
  packages that are listed in a certain Release file) or to all of the package
  versions coming from a particular Internet site, as identified by the site's
  fully qualified domain name.
<p class="Pp">This general-form entry in the APT preferences file applies only
    to groups of packages. For example, the following record assigns a high
    priority to all package versions available from the local site.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: *
Pin: origin &quot;&quot;
Pin-Priority: 999</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A note of caution: the keyword used here is &quot;origin&quot;
    which can be used to match a hostname. The following record will assign a
    high priority to all versions available from the server identified by the
    hostname &quot;ftp.de.debian.org&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: *
Pin: origin &quot;ftp.de.debian.org&quot;
Pin-Priority: 999</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This should <i>not</i> be confused with the Origin of a
    distribution as specified in a Release file. What follows the
    &quot;Origin:&quot; tag in a Release file is not an Internet address but an
    author or vendor name, such as &quot;Debian&quot; or &quot;Ximian&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following record assigns a low priority to all package
    versions belonging to any distribution whose Archive name is
    &quot;unstable&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: *
Pin: release a=unstable
Pin-Priority: 50</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The following record assigns a high priority to all package
    versions belonging to any distribution whose Codename is
  &quot;trixie&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: *
Pin: release n=trixie
Pin-Priority: 900</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The following record assigns a high priority to all package
    versions belonging to any release whose Archive name is &quot;stable&quot;
    and whose release Version number is &quot;12&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: *
Pin: release a=stable, v=12
Pin-Priority: 500</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The effect of the comma operator is similar to an &quot;and&quot;
    in logic: All conditions must be satisfied for the pin to match. There is
    one exception: For any type of condition (such as two &quot;a&quot;
    conditions), only the last such condition is checked.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Matching_packages_in_the_Package_field"><a class="permalink" href="#Matching_packages_in_the_Package_field">Matching
  packages in the Package field</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Package field specifies the package that a pinning priority is
    applied to. The field can either contain a binary package name, a source
    package name (prefixed with &quot;src:&quot;), a <b>glob</b>(7) expression
    or a regular expression (surrounded by slashes). Multiple package names,
    <b>glob</b>(7) expressions and regular expressions can be listed separated
    by whitespace in which case the record will match any of the matched
    packages.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, only packages of the native architecture are matched.
    To match binary packages of any architecture, add the :any suffix to the
    package name. You can also limit matching to a specific architecture by
    appending the architecture name to the package name, separated by a colon
    character.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the following example uses a glob expression and a
    regular expression to assign the priority 500 to all packages from
    experimental where the name starts with gnome (as a <b>glob</b>(7)-like
    expression) or contains the word kde (as a POSIX extended regular expression
    surrounded by slashes).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: gnome* /kde/
Pin: release a=experimental
Pin-Priority: 500</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The rule for those expressions is that they can occur anywhere
    where a string can occur. Thus, the following pin assigns the priority 990
    to all packages from a release starting with lunar.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: *
Pin: release n=lunar*
Pin-Priority: 990</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If a regular expression occurs in a Package field, the behavior is
    the same as if this regular expression were replaced with a list of all
    package names it matches. It is undecided whether this will change in the
    future; thus you should always list wild-card pins first, so later specific
    pins override it. The pattern &quot;*&quot; in a Package field is not
    considered a <b>glob</b>(7) expression in itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">To pin all binaries produced by the apt source package of this
    APT's version to 990, you can do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: src:apt
Pin: version 2.8.3
Pin-Priority: 990</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Source package pinning can be combined with regular expressions
    and glob patterns, and can also take a binary architecture.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, let's pin all binaries for all architectures produced
    by any source package containing apt in its name to 990:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: src:*apt*:any
Pin: version *
Pin-Priority: 990</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The :any suffix makes sure to select binary packages from any
    architecture. Without that suffix, apt implicitly assumes the :native suffix
    which would only select packages from the native architecture.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_APT_Interprets_Priorities"><a class="permalink" href="#How_APT_Interprets_Priorities">How
  APT Interprets Priorities</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Priorities (P) assigned in the APT preferences file must be
    positive or negative integers. They are interpreted as follows (roughly
    speaking):</p>
<p class="Pp">P &gt;= 1000</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">causes a version to be installed even if this constitutes
  a downgrade of the package</div>
<p class="Pp">990 &lt;= P &lt; 1000</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">causes a version to be installed even if it does not come
  from the target release, unless the installed version is more recent</div>
<p class="Pp">500 &lt;= P &lt; 990</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">causes a version to be installed unless there is a
  version available belonging to the target release or the installed version is
  more recent</div>
<p class="Pp">100 &lt;= P &lt; 500</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">causes a version to be installed unless there is a
  version available belonging to some other distribution or the installed
  version is more recent</div>
<p class="Pp">0 &lt; P &lt; 100</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">causes a version to be installed only if there is no
  installed version of the package</div>
<p class="Pp">P &lt; 0</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">prevents the version from being installed</div>
<p class="Pp">P = 0</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">has undefined behaviour, do not use it.</div>
<p class="Pp">The first specific-form record matching an available package
    version determines the priority of the package version. Failing that, the
    priority of the package is defined as the maximum of all priorities defined
    by generic-form records matching the version. Records defined using patterns
    in the Pin field other than &quot;*&quot; are treated like specific-form
    records.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose the APT preferences file contains the three
    records presented earlier:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Package: perl
Pin: version 5.32*
Pin-Priority: 1001
Package: *
Pin: origin &quot;&quot;
Pin-Priority: 999
Package: *
Pin: release unstable
Pin-Priority: 50</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Then:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The most recent available version of the perl
  package will be installed, so long as that version's version number begins
  with &quot;5.32&quot;. If <i>any</i> 5.32* version of perl is available and
  the installed version is 5.36*, then perl will be downgraded.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A version of any package other than perl that is
  available from the local system has priority over other versions, even
  versions belonging to the target release.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A version of a package whose origin is not the
  local system but some other site listed in <b>sources.list</b>(5) and which
  belongs to an unstable distribution is only installed if it is selected for
  installation and no version of the package is already installed.</div>

  of Package Version and Distribution Properties</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The locations listed in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file should
    provide Packages and Release files to describe the packages available at
    that location.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Packages file is normally found in the directory
    .../dists/<i>dist-name</i>/<i>component</i>/<i>arch</i>: for example,
    .../dists/stable/main/binary-i386/Packages. It consists of a series of
    multi-line records, one for each package available in that directory. Only
    two lines in each record are relevant for setting APT priorities:</p>
<p class="Pp">the Package: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">gives the package name</div>
<p class="Pp">the Version: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">gives the version number for the named package</div>
<p class="Pp">The Release file is normally found in the directory
    .../dists/<i>dist-name</i>: for example, .../dists/stable/Release, or
    .../dists/bookworm/Release. It consists of a single multi-line record which
    applies to <i>all</i> of the packages in the directory tree below its
    parent. Unlike the Packages file, nearly all of the lines in a Release file
    are relevant for setting APT priorities:</p>
<p class="Pp">the Archive: or Suite: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">names the archive to which all the packages in the
  directory tree belong. For example, the line &quot;Archive: stable&quot; or
  &quot;Suite: stable&quot; specifies that all of the packages in the directory
  tree below the parent of the Release file are in a stable archive. Specifying
  this value in the APT preferences file would require the line:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Pin: release a=stable</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the Codename: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">names the codename to which all the packages in the
  directory tree belong. For example, the line &quot;Codename: trixie&quot;
  specifies that all of the packages in the directory tree below the parent of
  the Release file belong to a version named trixie. Specifying this value in
  the APT preferences file would require the line:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Pin: release n=trixie</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the Version: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">names the release version. For example, the packages in
  the tree might belong to Debian release version 12. Note that there is
  normally no version number for the testing and unstable distributions because
  they have not been released yet. Specifying this in the APT preferences file
  would require one of the following lines.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Pin: release v=12
Pin: release a=stable, v=12
Pin: release 12</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the Component: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">names the licensing component associated with the
  packages in the directory tree of the Release file. For example, the line
  &quot;Component: main&quot; specifies that all the packages in the directory
  tree are from the main component, which entails that they are licensed under
  terms listed in the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Specifying this component
  in the APT preferences file would require the line:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Pin: release c=main</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the Origin: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">names the originator of the packages in the directory
  tree of the Release file. Most commonly, this is Debian. Specifying this
  origin in the APT preferences file would require the line:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Pin: release o=Debian</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the Label: line</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">names the label of the packages in the directory tree of

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Pin: release l=Debian</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">All of the Packages and Release files retrieved from locations
    listed in the <b>sources.list</b>(5) file are stored in the directory
    /var/lib/apt/lists, or in the file named by the variable Dir::State::Lists

    debian.lcs.mit.edu_debian_dists_unstable_contrib_binary-i386_Release
