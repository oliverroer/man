  <dd>The files in this directory provide an API for security modules. The
      contents of this directory are files that can be read and written in order
      to set security-related attributes. This directory was added to support
      SELinux, but the intention was that the API be general enough to support
      other security modules. For the purpose of explanation, examples of how
      SELinux uses these files are provided below.</dd>

  <dd>In SELinux, this file is used to get the security context of a process.
      Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this file could not be used to set the security
      context (a write was always denied), since SELinux limited process
      security transitions to <b>execve</b>(2) (see the description of
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/exec</i>, below). Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux
      lifted this restriction and began supporting &quot;set&quot; operations
      via writes to this node if authorized by policy, although use of this
      operation is only suitable for applications that are trusted to maintain
      any desired separation between the old and new security contexts.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Prior to Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads within a
      multithreaded process to set their security context via this node as it
      would yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the threads
      sharing the same memory space. Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted this
      restriction and began supporting &quot;set&quot; operations for threads
      within a multithreaded process if the new security context is bounded by
      the old security context, where the bounded relation is defined in policy
      and guarantees that the new security context has a subset of the
      permissions of the old security context.</dd>

  <dd>Other security modules may choose to support &quot;set&quot; operations

  <dd>In SELinux, this is needed to support role/domain transitions, and
      <b>execve</b>(2) is the preferred point to make such transitions because
      it offers better control over the initialization of the process in the new
      security label and the inheritance of state. In SELinux, this attribute is
      reset on <b>execve</b>(2) so that the new program reverts to the default
      behavior for any <b>execve</b>(2) calls that it may make. In SELinux, a
      process can set only its own <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/exec</i>
    attribute.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>SELinux employs this file to support creation of a file (using the
      aforementioned system calls) in a secure state, so that there is no risk
      of inappropriate access being obtained between the time of creation and
      the time that attributes are set. In SELinux, this attribute is reset on
      <b>execve</b>(2), so that the new program reverts to the default behavior
      for any file creation calls it may make, but the attribute will persist
      across multiple file creation calls within a program unless it is
      explicitly reset. In SELinux, a process can set only its own
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/fscreate</i> attribute.</dd>
