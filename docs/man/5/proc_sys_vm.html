  <dd>Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries, and

      for memory management testing and performing reproducible filesystem

  <dd>This writable file contains a group ID that is allowed to allocate memory
      using huge pages. If a process has a filesystem group ID or any
      supplementary group ID that matches this group ID, then it can make
      huge-page allocations without holding the <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b> capability;

  <dd>Control how to kill processes when an uncorrected memory error (typically
      a 2-bit error in a memory module) that cannot be handled by the kernel is
      detected in the background by hardware. In some cases (like the page still
      having a valid copy on disk), the kernel will handle the failure
      transparently without affecting any applications. But if there is no other
      up-to-date copy of the data, it will kill processes to prevent any data
      corruptions from propagating.</dd>

      CPU that the task is scheduled on, oom_adj score (see the description of
