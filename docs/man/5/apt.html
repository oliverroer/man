<p class="Pp">apt.conf - Configuration file for APT</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">/etc/apt/apt.conf is the main configuration file shared by all the
    tools in the APT suite of tools, though it is by no means the only place
    options can be set. The suite also shares a common command line parser to
    provide a uniform environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an APT tool starts up it will read the configuration files in
    the following order:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.the file specified by the <b>APT_CONFIG</b>
  environment variable (if any)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.all files in Dir::Etc::Parts in alphanumeric ascending
  order which have either no or &quot;conf&quot; as filename extension and which
  only contain alphanumeric, hyphen (-), underscore (_) and period (.)
  characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file,
  unless that file matches a pattern in the Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently
  configuration list - in which case it will be silently ignored.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.the main configuration file specified by
  Dir::Etc::main</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.all options set in the binary specific configuration
  subtree are moved into the root of the tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.the command line options are applied to override the
  configuration directives or to load even more configuration files.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNTAX"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNTAX">SYNTAX</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The configuration file is organized in a tree with options
    organized into functional groups. Option specification is given with a
    double colon notation; for instance APT::Get::Assume-Yes is an option within
    the APT tool group, for the Get tool. Options do not inherit from their
    parent groups.</p>
<p class="Pp">Syntactically the configuration language is modeled after what the
    ISC tools such as bind and dhcp use. Lines starting with // are treated as
    comments (ignored), as well as all text between /* and */, just like C/C++
    comments. Lines starting with # are also treated as comments. Each line is
    of the form APT::Get::Assume-Yes &quot;true&quot;;. The quotation marks and
    trailing semicolon are required. The value must be on one line, and there is
    no kind of string concatenation. Values must not include backslashes or
    extra quotation marks. Option names are made up of alphanumeric characters
    and the characters &quot;/-:._+&quot;. A new scope can be opened with curly
    braces, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   
APT {
<br/>
  Get {
<br/>
    Assume-Yes &quot;true&quot;;
<br/>
    Fix-Broken &quot;true&quot;;
<br/>
  };
};</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">with newlines placed to make it more readable. Lists can be
    created by opening a scope and including a single string enclosed in quotes
    followed by a semicolon. Multiple entries can be included, separated by a
    semicolon.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
   
DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {&quot;/usr/sbin/dpkg-preconfigure --apt&quot;;};</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In general the sample configuration file
    /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index is a good guide for how it
    should look.</p>
<p class="Pp">Case is not significant in names of configuration items, so in the
    previous example you could use dpkg::pre-install-pkgs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names for the configuration items are optional if a list is
    defined as can be seen in the DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs example above. If you
    don't specify a name a new entry will simply add a new option to the list.
    If you specify a name you can override the option in the same way as any
    other option by reassigning a new value to the option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two special commands are defined: #include (which is deprecated
    and not supported by alternative implementations) and #clear. #include will
    include the given file, unless the filename ends in a slash, in which case
    the whole directory is included. #clear is used to erase a part of the
    configuration tree. The specified element and all its descendants are
    erased. (Note that these lines also need to end with a semicolon.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The #clear command is the only way to delete a list or a complete
    scope. Reopening a scope (or using the syntax described below with an
    appended ::) will <i>not</i> override previously written entries. Options
    can only be overridden by addressing a new value to them - lists and scopes
    can't be overridden, only cleared.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the APT tools take an -o option which allows an arbitrary
    configuration directive to be specified on the command line. The syntax is a
    full option name (APT::Get::Assume-Yes for instance) followed by an equals
    sign then the new value of the option. To append a new element to a list,
    add a trailing :: to the name of the list. (As you might suspect, the scope
    syntax can't be used on the command line.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that appending items to a list using :: only works for one
    item per line, and that you should not use it in combination with the scope
    syntax (which adds :: implicitly). Using both syntaxes together will trigger
    a bug which some users unfortunately depend on: an option with the unusual
    name &quot;::&quot; which acts like every other option with a name. This
    introduces many problems; for one thing, users who write multiple lines in
    this <i>wrong</i> syntax in the hope of appending to a list will achieve the
    opposite, as only the last assignment for this option &quot;::&quot; will be
    used. Future versions of APT will raise errors and stop working if they
    encounter this misuse, so please correct such statements now while APT
    doesn't explicitly complain about them.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_APT_GROUP"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_APT_GROUP">THE
  APT GROUP</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This group of options controls general APT behavior as well as
    holding the options for all of the tools.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Architecture</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">System Architecture; sets the architecture to use when
  fetching files and parsing package lists. The internal default is the
  architecture apt was compiled for.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Architectures</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All Architectures the system supports. For instance, CPUs
  implementing the amd64 (also called x86-64) instruction set are also able to
  execute binaries compiled for the i386 (x86) instruction set. This list is
  used when fetching files and parsing package lists. The initial default is
  always the system's native architecture (APT::Architecture), and foreign
  architectures are added to the default list when they are registered via
  <b>dpkg --add-architecture</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Compressor</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This scope defines which compression formats are
  supported, how compression and decompression can be performed if support for
  this format isn't built into apt directly and a cost-value indicating how
  costly it is to compress something in this format. As an example the following
  configuration stanza would allow apt to download and uncompress as well as
  create and store files with the low-cost .reversed file extension which it
  will pass to the command <b>rev</b> without additional commandline parameters
  for compression and uncompression:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>APT::Compressor::rev {
	Name &quot;rev&quot;;
	Extension &quot;.reversed&quot;;
	Binary &quot;rev&quot;;
	CompressArg {};
	UncompressArg {};
	Cost &quot;10&quot;;
};</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Build-Profiles</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List of all build profiles enabled for build-dependency
  resolution, without the &quot;profile.&quot; namespace prefix. By default this
  list is empty. The <b>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES</b> as used by
  <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>(1) overrides the list notation.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Default-Release</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Default release to install packages from if more than one
  version is available. Contains release name, codename or release version.
  Examples: 'stable', 'testing', 'unstable', 'bookworm', 'trixie', '4.0',
  '5.0*'. See also <b>apt_preferences</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Snapshot</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Snapshot to use for all repositories configured with
  Snapshot: yes. See also <b>sources.list</b>(5), the <b>--snapshot</b> option
  that sets this value, and <b>Acquire::Snapshots::URI</b> below.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Ignore-Hold</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore held packages; this global option causes the
  problem resolver to ignore held packages in its decision making.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Clean-Installed</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defaults to on. When turned on the autoclean feature will
  remove any packages which can no longer be downloaded from the cache. If
  turned off then packages that are locally installed are also excluded from
  cleaning - but note that APT provides no direct means to reinstall them.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Immediate-Configure</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defaults to on, which will cause APT to install essential
  and important packages as soon as possible in an install/upgrade operation, in
  order to limit the effect of a failing <b>dpkg</b>(1) call. If this option is
  disabled, APT treats an important package in the same way as an extra package:
  between the unpacking of the package A and its configuration there can be many
  other unpack or configuration calls for other unrelated packages B, C etc. If
  these cause the <b>dpkg</b>(1) call to fail (e.g. because package B's
  maintainer scripts generate an error), this results in a system state in which
  package A is unpacked but unconfigured - so any package depending on A is now
  no longer guaranteed to work, as its dependency on A is no longer satisfied.
<p class="Pp">The immediate configuration marker is also applied in the
    potentially problematic case of circular dependencies, since a dependency
    with the immediate flag is equivalent to a Pre-Dependency. In theory this
    allows APT to recognise a situation in which it is unable to perform
    immediate configuration, abort, and suggest to the user that the option
    should be temporarily deactivated in order to allow the operation to
    proceed. Note the use of the word &quot;theory&quot; here; in the real world
    this problem has rarely been encountered, in non-stable distribution
    versions, and was caused by wrong dependencies of the package in question or
    by a system in an already broken state; so you should not blindly disable
    this option, as the scenario mentioned above is not the only problem it can
    help to prevent in the first place.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before a big operation like dist-upgrade is run with this option
    disabled you should try to explicitly install the package APT is unable to
    configure immediately; but please make sure you also report your problem to
    your distribution and to the APT team with the bug link below, so they can
    work on improving or correcting the upgrade process.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Force-LoopBreak</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Never enable this option unless you <i>really</i> know
  what you are doing. It permits APT to temporarily remove an essential package
  to break a Conflicts/Conflicts or Conflicts/Pre-Depends loop between two
  essential packages. <i>Such a loop should never exist and is a grave bug</i>.
  This option will work if the essential packages are not <b>tar</b>,
  <b>gzip</b>, <b>libc</b>, <b>dpkg</b>, <b>dash</b> or anything that those
  packages depend on.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Cache-Start</b>, <b>Cache-Grow</b>, <b>Cache-Limit</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">APT uses since version 0.7.26 a resizable memory mapped
  cache file to store the available information. Cache-Start acts as a hint of
  the size the cache will grow to, and is therefore the amount of memory APT
  will request at startup. The default value is 20971520 bytes (~20 MB). Note
  that this amount of space needs to be available for APT; otherwise it will
  likely fail ungracefully, so for memory restricted devices this value should
  be lowered while on systems with a lot of configured sources it should be
  increased. Cache-Grow defines in bytes with the default of 1048576 (~1 MB) how
  much the cache size will be increased in the event the space defined by
  Cache-Start is not enough. This value will be applied again and again until
  either the cache is big enough to store all information or the size of the
  cache reaches the Cache-Limit. The default of Cache-Limit is 0 which stands
  for no limit. If Cache-Grow is set to 0 the automatic growth of the cache is
  disabled.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Build-Essential</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines which packages are considered essential build
  dependencies.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Get</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The Get subsection controls the <b>apt-get</b>(8) tool;
  please see its documentation for more information about the options
  here.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Cache</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The Cache subsection controls the <b>apt-cache</b>(8)
  tool; please see its documentation for more information about the options
  here.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>CDROM</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The CDROM subsection controls the <b>apt-cdrom</b>(8)
  tool; please see its documentation for more information about the options
  here.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>NeverAutoRemove</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Never autoremove packages that match the regular
  expression(s).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Protect-Kernels</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option tells apt autoremove that kernels are
  protected and defaults to true. In case kernels are not protected they are
  treated as any other package.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>VersionedKernelPackages</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Define the regular expression(s) for versioned kernel
  packages. Based on these expressions a rule set is injected into apt similar
  to APT::NeverAutoRemove regular expressions.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>NeverAutoRemove::KernelCount</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Keep a custom amount of kernels when autoremoving and
  defaults to 2, meaning two kernels are kept. Apt will always keep the running
  kernel and the latest one. If the latest kernel is the same as the running
  kernel, the second latest kernel is kept. Because of this, any value lower
  than 2 will be ignored. If you want only the latest kernel, you should set
  APT::Protect-Kernels to false.</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_ACQUIRE_GROUP"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_ACQUIRE_GROUP">THE
  ACQUIRE GROUP</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Acquire group of options controls the download of packages as
    well as the various &quot;acquire methods&quot; responsible for the download
    itself (see also <b>sources.list</b>(5)).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Check-Date</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Security related option defaulting to true, enabling
  time-related checks. Disabling it means that the machine's time cannot be
  trusted, and APT will hence disable all time-related checks, such as
  <b>Check-Valid-Until</b> and verifying that the Date field of a release file
  is not in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Max-FutureTime</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum time (in seconds) before its creation (as
  indicated by the Date header) that the Release file should be considered
  valid. The default value is 10. Archive specific settings can be made by
  appending the label of the archive to the option name. Preferably, the same
  can be achieved for specific <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries by using the
  <b>Date-Max-Future</b> option there.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Check-Valid-Until</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Security related option defaulting to true, as giving a
  Release file's validation an expiration date prevents replay attacks over a
  long timescale, and can also for example help users to identify mirrors that
  are no longer updated - but the feature depends on the correctness of the
  clock on the user system. Archive maintainers are encouraged to create Release
  files with the Valid-Until header, but if they don't or a stricter value is
  desired the Max-ValidTime option below can be used. The
  <b>Check-Valid-Until</b> option of <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries should be
  preferred to disable the check selectively instead of using this global
  override.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Max-ValidTime</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum time (in seconds) after its creation (as
  indicated by the Date header) that the Release file should be considered
  valid. If the Release file itself includes a Valid-Until header the earlier
  date of the two is used as the expiration date. The default value is 0 which
  stands for &quot;valid forever&quot;. Archive specific settings can be made by
  appending the label of the archive to the option name. Preferably, the same
  can be achieved for specific <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries by using the
  <b>Valid-Until-Max</b> option there.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Min-ValidTime</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Minimum time (in seconds) after its creation (as
  indicated by the Date header) that the Release file should be considered
  valid. Use this if you need to use a seldom updated (local) mirror of a more
  frequently updated archive with a Valid-Until header instead of completely
  disabling the expiration date checking. Archive specific settings can and
  should be used by appending the label of the archive to the option name.
  Preferably, the same can be achieved for specific <b>sources.list</b>(5)
  entries by using the <b>Valid-Until-Min</b> option there.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>AllowTLS</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow use of the internal TLS support in the http method.
  If set to false, this completely disables support for TLS in apt's own methods
  (excluding the curl-based https method). No TLS-related functions will be
  called anymore.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>PDiffs</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Try to download deltas called PDiffs for indexes (like
  Packages files) instead of downloading whole ones. True by default.
  Preferably, this can be set for specific <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries or
  index files by using the <b>PDiffs</b> option there.
<p class="Pp">Two sub-options to limit the use of PDiffs are also available:
    FileLimit can be used to specify a maximum number of PDiff files should be
    downloaded to update a file. SizeLimit on the other hand is the maximum
    percentage of the size of all patches compared to the size of the targeted
    file. If one of these limits is exceeded the complete file is downloaded
    instead of the patches.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>By-Hash</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Try to download indexes via an URI constructed from a
  hashsum of the expected file rather than downloaded via a well-known stable
  filename. True by default, but automatically disabled if the source indicates
  no support for it. Usage can be forced with the special value
  &quot;force&quot;. Preferably, this can be set for specific
  <b>sources.list</b>(5) entries or index files by using the <b>By-Hash</b>
  option there.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Queue-Mode</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Queuing mode; Queue-Mode can be one of host or access
  which determines how APT parallelizes outgoing connections. host means that
  one connection per target host will be opened, access means that one
  connection per URI type will be opened.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Retries</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Number of retries to perform. If this is non-zero APT
  will retry failed files the given number of times.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Source-Symlinks</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use symlinks for source archives. If set to true then
  source archives will be symlinked when possible instead of copying. True is
  the default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>http</b> <b>https</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The options in these scopes configure APT's acquire
  transports for the protocols HTTP and HTTPS and are documented in the
  <b>apt-transport-http</b>(1) and <b>apt-transport-https</b>(1) manpages
  respectively.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>ftp</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">ftp::Proxy sets the default proxy to use for FTP URIs. It
  is in the standard form of ftp://[[user][:pass]@]host[:port]/. Per host
  proxies can also be specified by using the form ftp::Proxy::&lt;host&gt; with
  the special keyword DIRECT meaning to use no proxies. If no one of the above
  settings is specified, <b>ftp_proxy</b> environment variable will be used. To
  use an FTP proxy you will have to set the ftp::ProxyLogin script in the
  configuration file. This entry specifies the commands to send to tell the
  proxy server what to connect to. Please see
  /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index for an example of how to do this.
  The substitution variables representing the corresponding URI component are
  $(PROXY_USER), $(PROXY_PASS), $(SITE_USER), $(SITE_PASS), $(SITE) and
  $(SITE_PORT).
<p class="Pp">The option timeout sets the timeout timer used by the method; this
    value applies to the connection as well as the data timeout.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several settings are provided to control passive mode. Generally
    it is safe to leave passive mode on; it works in nearly every environment.
    However, some situations require that passive mode be disabled and port mode
    FTP used instead. This can be done globally or for connections that go
    through a proxy or for a specific host (see the sample config file for
    examples).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to proxy FTP over HTTP by setting the
    <b>ftp_proxy</b> environment variable to an HTTP URL - see the discussion of
    the http method above for syntax. You cannot set this in the configuration
    file and it is not recommended to use FTP over HTTP due to its low
    efficiency.</p>
<p class="Pp">The setting ForceExtended controls the use of RFC2428 EPSV and
    EPRT commands. The default is false, which means these commands are only
    used if the control connection is IPv6. Setting this to true forces their
    use even on IPv4 connections. Note that most FTP servers do not support
    RFC2428.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cdrom</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For URIs using the cdrom method, the only configurable
  option is the mount point, cdrom::Mount, which must be the mount point for the
  CD-ROM (or DVD, or whatever) drive as specified in /etc/fstab. It is possible
  to provide alternate mount and unmount commands if your mount point cannot be
  listed in the fstab. The syntax is to put
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/cdrom/::Mount &quot;foo&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">within the cdrom block. It is important to have the trailing
    slash. Unmount commands can be specified using UMount.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>gpgv</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For GPGV URIs the only configurable option is
  gpgv::Options, which passes additional parameters to gpgv.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>CompressionTypes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List of compression types which are understood by the
  acquire methods. Files like Packages can be available in various compression
  formats. By default the acquire methods can decompress and recompress many
  common formats like <b>xz</b> and <b>gzip</b>; with this scope the supported
  formats can be queried, modified as well as support for more formats added
  (see also <b>APT::Compressor</b>). The syntax for this is:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Acquire::CompressionTypes::<i>FileExtension</i> &quot;<i>Methodname</i>&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Also, the Order subgroup can be used to define in which order the
    acquire system will try to download the compressed files. The acquire system
    will try the first and proceed with the next compression type in this list
    on error, so to prefer one over the other type simply add the preferred type
    first - types not already added will be implicitly appended to the end of
    the list, so e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Acquire::CompressionTypes::Order:: &quot;gz&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">can be used to prefer <b>gzip</b> compressed files over all other
    compression formats. If <b>xz</b> should be preferred over <b>gzip</b> and
    <b>bzip2</b> the configure setting should look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Acquire::CompressionTypes::Order { &quot;xz&quot;; &quot;gz&quot;; };</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">It is not needed to add bz2 to the list explicitly as it will be
    added automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the Dir::Bin::<i>Methodname</i> will be checked at run
    time. If this option has been set and support for this format isn't directly
    built into apt, the method will only be used if this file exists; e.g. for
    the bzip2 method (the inbuilt) setting is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Dir::Bin::bzip2 &quot;/bin/bzip2&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note also that list entries specified on the command line will be
    added at the end of the list specified in the configuration files, but
    before the default entries. To prefer a type in this case over the ones
    specified in the configuration files you can set the option direct - not in
    list style. This will not override the defined list; it will only prefix the
    list with this type.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special type uncompressed can be used to give uncompressed
    files a preference, but note that most archives don't provide uncompressed
    files so this is mostly only usable for local mirrors.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>GzipIndexes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When downloading gzip compressed indexes (Packages,
  Sources, or Translations), keep them gzip compressed locally instead of
  unpacking them. This saves quite a lot of disk space at the expense of more
  CPU requirements when building the local package caches. False by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Languages</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The Languages subsection controls which Translation files
  are downloaded and in which order APT tries to display the
  description-translations. APT will try to display the first available
  description in the language which is listed first. Languages can be defined
  with their short or long language codes. Note that not all archives provide
  Translation files for every language - the long language codes are especially
  rare.
<p class="Pp">The default list includes &quot;environment&quot; and
    &quot;en&quot;. &quot;environment&quot; has a special meaning here: it will
    be replaced at runtime with the language codes extracted from the
    LC_MESSAGES environment variable. It will also ensure that these codes are
    not included twice in the list. If LC_MESSAGES is set to &quot;C&quot; only
    the Translation-en file (if available) will be used. To force APT to use no
    Translation file use the setting Acquire::Languages=none. &quot;none&quot;
    is another special meaning code which will stop the search for a suitable
    Translation file. This tells APT to download these translations too, without
    actually using them unless the environment specifies the languages. So the
    following example configuration will result in the order &quot;en, de&quot;
    in an English locale or &quot;de, en&quot; in a German one. Note that
    &quot;fr&quot; is downloaded, but not used unless APT is used in a French
    locale (where the order would be &quot;fr, de, en&quot;).</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Acquire::Languages { &quot;environment&quot;; &quot;de&quot;; &quot;en&quot;; &quot;none&quot;; &quot;fr&quot;; };</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note: To prevent problems resulting from APT being executed in
    different environments (e.g. by different users or by other programs) all
    Translation files which are found in /var/lib/apt/lists/ will be added to
    the end of the list (after an implicit &quot;none&quot;).</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>ForceIPv6</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When downloading, force to use only the IPv6
  protocol.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>MaxReleaseFileSize</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum file size of Release/Release.gpg/InRelease
  files. The default is 10MB.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>EnableSrvRecords</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option controls if apt will use the DNS SRV server
  record as specified in RFC 2782 to select an alternative server to connect to.
  The default is &quot;true&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>AllowInsecureRepositories</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow update operations to load data files from
  repositories without sufficient security information. The default value is
  &quot;false&quot;. Concept, implications as well as alternatives are detailed
  in <b>apt-secure</b>(8).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>AllowWeakRepositories</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow update operations to load data files from
  repositories which provide security information, but these are deemed no
  longer cryptographically strong enough. The default value is
  &quot;false&quot;. Concept, implications as well as alternatives are detailed
  in <b>apt-secure</b>(8).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>AllowDowngradeToInsecureRepositories</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow that a repository that was previously gpg signed to
  become unsigned during an update operation. When there is no valid signature
  for a previously trusted repository apt will refuse the update. This option
  can be used to override this protection. You almost certainly never want to
  enable this. The default is false. Concept, implications as well as
  alternatives are detailed in <b>apt-secure</b>(8).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Changelogs::URI</b> scope</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Acquiring changelogs can only be done if an URI is known
  from where to get them. Preferable the Release file indicates this in a
  'Changelogs' field. If this isn't available the Label/Origin field of the
  Release file is used to check if a
  Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Label::<i>LABEL</i> or
  Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Origin::<i>ORIGIN</i> option exists and if so this
  value is taken. The value in the Release file can be overridden with
  Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Override::Label::<i>LABEL</i> or
  Acquire::Changelogs::URI::Override::Origin::<i>ORIGIN</i>. The value should be
  a normal URI to a text file, except that package specific data is replaced
  with the placeholder @CHANGEPATH@. The value for it is: 1. if the package is
  from a component (e.g. main) this is the first part otherwise it is omitted,
  2. the first letter of source package name, except if the source package name
  starts with 'lib' in which case it will be the first four letters. 3. The
  complete source package name. 4. the complete name again and 5. the source
  version. The first (if present), second, third and fourth part are separated
  by a slash ('/') and between the fourth and fifth part is an underscore ('_').
  The special value 'no' is available for this option indicating that this
  source can't be used to acquire changelog files from. Another source will be
  tried if available in this case.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Snapshots::URI</b> scope</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like changelogs, snapshots can only be acquired if an URI
  is known from where to get them. Preferable the Release file indicates this in
  a 'Snapshots' field. If this isn't available the Label/Origin field of the
  Release file is used to check if a
  Acquire::Snapshots::URI::Label::<i>LABEL</i> or
  Acquire::Snapshots::URI::Origin::<i>ORIGIN</i> option exists and if so this
  value is taken. The value in the Release file can be overridden with
  Acquire::Snapshots::URI::Override::Label::<i>LABEL</i> or
  Acquire::Snapshots::URI::Override::Origin::<i>ORIGIN</i>. The value should be
  a normal URI to a directory, except that the snapshot ID replaced with the
  placeholder @SNAPSHOTID. The special value 'no' is available for this option
  indicating that this source cannot be used to acquire snapshots from. Another
  source will be tried if available in this case.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BINARY_SPECIFIC_CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#BINARY_SPECIFIC_CONFIGURATION">BINARY
  SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Especially with the introduction of the <b>apt</b> binary it can
    be useful to set certain options only for a specific binary as even options
    which look like they would effect only a certain binary like
    <b>APT::Get::Show-Versions</b> effect <b>apt-get</b> as well as
  <b>apt</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting an option for a specific binary only can be achieved by
    setting the option inside the <b>Binary::</b><b></b><i>specific-binary</i>
    scope. Setting the option <b>APT::Get::Show-Versions</b> for the <b>apt</b>
    only can e.g. by done by setting <b>Binary::apt::APT::Get::Show-Versions</b>
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that as seen in the DESCRIPTION section further above you
    can't set binary-specific options on the commandline itself nor in
    configuration files loaded via the commandline.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DIRECTORIES"><a class="permalink" href="#DIRECTORIES">DIRECTORIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Dir::State section has directories that pertain to local state
    information. lists is the directory to place downloaded package lists in and
    status is the name of the <b>dpkg</b>(1) status file. preferences is the
    name of the APT preferences file. Dir::State contains the default directory
    to prefix on all sub-items if they do not start with / or ./.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dir::Cache contains locations pertaining to local cache
    information, such as the two package caches srcpkgcache and pkgcache as well
    as the location to place downloaded archives, Dir::Cache::archives.
    Generation of caches can be turned off by setting pkgcache or srcpkgcache to
    &quot;&quot;. This will slow down startup but save disk space. It is
    probably preferable to turn off the pkgcache rather than the srcpkgcache.
    Like Dir::State the default directory is contained in Dir::Cache</p>
<p class="Pp">Dir::Etc contains the location of configuration files, sourcelist
    gives the location of the sourcelist and main is the default configuration
    file (setting has no effect, unless it is done from the config file
    specified by <b>APT_CONFIG</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The Dir::Parts setting reads in all the config fragments in
    lexical order from the directory specified. After this is done then the main
    config file is loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary programs are pointed to by Dir::Bin. Dir::Bin::Methods
    specifies the location of the method handlers and gzip, bzip2, lzma, dpkg,
    apt-get dpkg-source dpkg-buildpackage and apt-cache specify the location of
    the respective programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration item RootDir has a special meaning. If set, all
    paths will be relative to RootDir, <i>even paths that are specified
    absolutely</i>. So, for instance, if RootDir is set to /tmp/staging and
    Dir::State::status is set to /var/lib/dpkg/status, then the status file will
    be looked up in /tmp/staging/var/lib/dpkg/status. If you want to prefix only
    relative paths, set Dir instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Ignore-Files-Silently list can be used to specify which files
    APT should silently ignore while parsing the files in the fragment
    directories. Per default a file which ends with .disabled, ~, .bak or
    .dpkg-[a-z]+ is silently ignored. As seen in the last default value these
    patterns can use regular expression syntax.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="APT_IN_DSELECT"><a class="permalink" href="#APT_IN_DSELECT">APT
  IN DSELECT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When APT is used as a <b>dselect</b>(1) method several
    configuration directives control the default behavior. These are in the
    DSelect section.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Clean</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Cache Clean mode; this value may be one of always,
  prompt, auto, pre-auto and never. always and prompt will remove all packages
  from the cache after upgrading, prompt (the default) does so conditionally.
  auto removes only those packages which are no longer downloadable (replaced
  with a new version for instance). pre-auto performs this action before
  downloading new packages.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>options</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The contents of this variable are passed to
  <b>apt-get</b>(8) as command line options when it is run for the install
  phase.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Updateoptions</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The contents of this variable are passed to
  <b>apt-get</b>(8) as command line options when it is run for the update
  phase.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>PromptAfterUpdate</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true the [U]pdate operation in <b>dselect</b>(1) will
  always prompt to continue. The default is to prompt only on error.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_APT_CALLS_DPKG(1)"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_APT_CALLS_DPKG(1)">HOW
  APT CALLS DPKG(1)</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Several configuration directives control how APT invokes
    <b>dpkg</b>(1). These are in the DPkg section.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>options</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a list of options to pass to <b>dpkg</b>(1). The
  options must be specified using the list notation and each list item is passed
  as a single argument to <b>dpkg</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Path</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a string that defines the <b>PATH</b> environment
  variable used when running dpkg. It may be set to any valid value of that
  environment variable; or the empty string, in which case the variable is not
  changed.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Pre-Invoke</b>, <b>Post-Invoke</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a list of shell commands to run before/after
  invoking <b>dpkg</b>(1). Like options this must be specified in list notation.
  The commands are invoked in order using /bin/sh; should any fail APT will
  abort.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Pre-Install-Pkgs</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a list of shell commands to run before invoking
  <b>dpkg</b>(1). Like options this must be specified in list notation. The
  commands are invoked in order using /bin/sh; should any fail APT will abort.
  APT will pass the filenames of all .deb files it is going to install to the
  commands, one per line on the requested file descriptor, defaulting to
  standard input.
<p class="Pp">Version 2 of this protocol sends more information through the
    requested file descriptor: a line with the text VERSION 2, the APT
    configuration space, and a list of package actions with filename and version
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each configuration directive line has the form key=value. Special
    characters (equal signs, newlines, nonprintable characters, quotation marks,
    and percent signs in key and newlines, nonprintable characters, and percent
    signs in value) are %-encoded. Lists are represented by multiple key::=value
    lines with the same key. The configuration section ends with a blank
  line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Package action lines consist of five fields in Version 2: package
    name (without architecture qualification even if foreign), old version,
    direction of version change (&lt; for upgrades, &gt; for downgrades, = for
    no change), new version, action. The version fields are &quot;-&quot; for no
    version at all (for example when installing a package for the first time; no
    version is treated as earlier than any real version, so that is an upgrade,
    indicated as - &lt; 1.23.4). The action field is &quot;**CONFIGURE**&quot;
    if the package is being configured, &quot;**REMOVE**&quot; if it is being
    removed, or the filename of a .deb file if it is being unpacked.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Version 3 after each version field follows the architecture of
    this version, which is &quot;-&quot; if there is no version, and a field
    showing the MultiArch type &quot;same&quot;, &quot;foreign&quot;,
    &quot;allowed&quot; or &quot;none&quot;. Note that &quot;none&quot; is an
    incorrect typename which is just kept to remain compatible, it should be
    read as &quot;no&quot; and users are encouraged to support both.</p>
<p class="Pp">The version of the protocol to be used for the command <i>cmd</i>
    can be chosen by setting DPkg::Tools::options::<i>cmd</i>::Version
    accordingly, the default being version 1. If APT isn't supporting the
    requested version it will send the information in the highest version it has
    support for instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file descriptor to be used to send the information can be
    requested with DPkg::Tools::options::<i>cmd</i>::InfoFD which defaults to 0
    for standard input and is available since version 0.9.11. Support for the
    option can be detected by looking for the environment variable
    <b>APT_HOOK_INFO_FD</b> which contains the number of the used file
    descriptor as a confirmation.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Run-Directory</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">APT chdirs to this directory before invoking
  <b>dpkg</b>(1), the default is /.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Build-options</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These options are passed to <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>(1)
  when compiling packages; the default is to disable signing and produce all
  binaries.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>DPkg::ConfigurePending</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this option is set APT will call <b>dpkg --configure
  --pending</b> to let <b>dpkg</b>(1) handle all required configurations and
  triggers. This option is activated by default, but deactivating it could be
  useful if you want to run APT multiple times in a row - e.g. in an installer.
  In this scenario you could deactivate this option in all but the last
  run.</div>
