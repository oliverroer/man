<p class="Pp">The second, third, and fourth extended file systems, or ext2,
    ext3, and ext4 as they are commonly known, are Linux file systems that have
    historically been the default file system for many Linux distributions. They
    are general purpose file systems that have been designed for extensibility
    and backwards compatibility. In particular, file systems previously intended
    for use with the ext2 and ext3 file systems can be mounted using the ext4
    file system driver, and indeed in many modern Linux distributions, the ext4
    file system driver has been configured to handle mount requests for ext2 and
    ext3 file systems.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FILE_SYSTEM_FEATURES"><a class="permalink" href="#FILE_SYSTEM_FEATURES">FILE
  SYSTEM FEATURES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A file system formatted for ext2, ext3, or ext4 can have some
    collection of the following file system feature flags enabled. Some of these
    features are not supported by all implementations of the ext2, ext3, and
    ext4 file system drivers, depending on Linux kernel version in use. On other
    operating systems, such as the GNU/HURD or FreeBSD, only a very restrictive
    set of file system features may be supported in their implementations of
    ext2.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>64bit</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Enables the file system to be larger than 2^32 blocks. This feature is set
      automatically, as needed, but it can be useful to specify this feature
      explicitly if the file system might need to be resized larger than 2^32
      blocks, even if it was smaller than that threshold when it was originally
      created. Note that some older kernels and older versions of e2fsprogs will
      not support file systems with this ext4 feature enabled.</dd>
  <dt id="bigalloc"><a class="permalink" href="#bigalloc"><b>bigalloc</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature enables clustered block allocation, so that the unit of
      allocation is a power of two number of blocks. That is, each bit in the
      what had traditionally been known as the block allocation bitmap now
      indicates whether a cluster is in use or not, where a cluster is by
      default composed of 16 blocks. This feature can decrease the time spent on
      doing block allocation and brings smaller fragmentation, especially for
      large files. The size can be specified using the <b>mke2fs -C</b>
    option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>Warning:</b> The bigalloc feature is still under development, and may
      not be fully supported with your kernel or may have various bugs. Please
      see the web page http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Bigalloc for
      details. May clash with delayed allocation (see <b>nodelalloc</b> mount
      option).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature requires that the <b>extent</b> feature be enabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="casefold"><a class="permalink" href="#casefold"><b>casefold</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature provides file system level character encoding support for
      directories with the casefold (+F) flag enabled. This feature is
      name-preserving on the disk, but it allows applications to lookup for a
      file in the file system using an encoding equivalent version of the file
      name.</dd>
  <dt id="dir_index"><a class="permalink" href="#dir_index"><b>dir_index</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Use hashed b-trees to speed up name lookups in large directories. This
      feature is supported by ext3 and ext4 file systems, and is ignored by ext2
      file systems.</dd>
  <dt id="dir_nlink"><a class="permalink" href="#dir_nlink"><b>dir_nlink</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Normally, ext4 allows an inode to have no more than 65,000 hard links. This
      applies to regular files as well as directories, which means that there
      can be no more than 64,998 subdirectories in a directory (because each of
      the '.' and '..' entries, as well as the directory entry for the directory
      in its parent directory counts as a hard link). This feature lifts this
      limit by causing ext4 to use a link count of 1 to indicate that the number
      of hard links to a directory is not known when the link count might exceed
      the maximum count limit.</dd>
  <dt id="ea_inode"><a class="permalink" href="#ea_inode"><b>ea_inode</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Normally, a file's extended attributes and associated metadata must fit
      within the inode or the inode's associated extended attribute block. This
      feature allows the value of each extended attribute to be placed in the
      data blocks of a separate inode if necessary, increasing the limit on the
      size and number of extended attributes per file.</dd>
  <dt id="encrypt"><a class="permalink" href="#encrypt"><b>encrypt</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Enables support for file-system level encryption of data blocks and file
      names. The inode metadata (timestamps, file size, user/group ownership,
      etc.) is <i>not</i> encrypted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature is most useful on file systems with multiple users, or where
      not all files should be encrypted. In many use cases, especially on
      single-user systems, encryption at the block device layer using dm-crypt
      may provide much better security.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ext_attr"><a class="permalink" href="#ext_attr"><b>ext_attr</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature enables the use of extended attributes. This feature is
      supported by ext2, ext3, and ext4.</dd>
  <dt id="extent"><a class="permalink" href="#extent"><b>extent</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature allows the mapping of logical block numbers for a
      particular inode to physical blocks on the storage device to be stored
      using an extent tree, which is a more efficient data structure than the
      traditional indirect block scheme used by the ext2 and ext3 file systems.
      The use of the extent tree decreases metadata block overhead, improves
      file system performance, and decreases the needed to run <b>e2fsck</b>(8)
      on the file system. (Note: both <b>extent</b> and <b>extents</b> are
      accepted as valid names for this feature for historical/backwards
      compatibility reasons.)</dd>
  <dt id="extra_isize"><a class="permalink" href="#extra_isize"><b>extra_isize</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature reserves a specific amount of space in each inode for
      extended metadata such as nanosecond timestamps and file creation time,
      even if the current kernel does not currently need to reserve this much
      space. Without this feature, the kernel will reserve the amount of space
      for features it currently needs, and the rest may be consumed by extended
      attributes.
    <p class="Pp">For this feature to be useful the inode size must be 256 bytes
        in size or larger.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="filetype"><a class="permalink" href="#filetype"><b>filetype</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature enables the storage of file type information in directory
      entries. This feature is supported by ext2, ext3, and ext4.</dd>
  <dt id="flex_bg"><a class="permalink" href="#flex_bg"><b>flex_bg</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature allows the per-block group metadata (allocation bitmaps
      and inode tables) to be placed anywhere on the storage media. In addition,
      <b>mke2fs</b> will place the per-block group metadata together starting at
      the first block group of each &quot;flex_bg group&quot;. The size of the
      flex_bg group can be specified using the <b>-G</b> option.</dd>
  <dt id="has_journal"><a class="permalink" href="#has_journal"><b>has_journal</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Create a journal to ensure file system consistency even across unclean
      shutdowns. Setting the file system feature is equivalent to using the
      <b>-j</b> option with <b>mke2fs</b> or <b>tune2fs.</b> This feature is
      supported by ext3 and ext4, and ignored by the ext2 file system
    driver.</dd>
  <dt id="huge_file"><a class="permalink" href="#huge_file"><b>huge_file</b></a></dt>

  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature is enabled on the superblock found on an external journal
      device. The block size for the external journal must be the same as the
      file system which uses it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The external journal device can be used by a file system by specifying the

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="large_dir"><a class="permalink" href="#large_dir"><b>large_dir</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature increases the limit on the number of files per directory by
      raising the maximum size of directories and, for hashed b-tree directories
      (see <b>dir_index</b>), the maximum height of the hashed b-tree used to
      store the directory entries.</dd>
  <dt id="large_file"><a class="permalink" href="#large_file"><b>large_file</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature flag is set automatically by modern kernels when a file larger
      than 2 gigabytes is created. Very old kernels could not handle large
      files, so this feature flag was used to prohibit those kernels from
      mounting file systems that they could not understand.</dd>
  <dt id="metadata_csum"><a class="permalink" href="#metadata_csum"><b>metadata_csum</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature enables metadata checksumming. This feature stores
      checksums for all of the file system metadata (superblock, group
      descriptor blocks, inode and block bitmaps, directories, and extent tree
      blocks). The checksum algorithm used for the metadata blocks is different
      than the one used for group descriptors with the <b>uninit_bg</b> feature.
      These two features are incompatible and <b>metadata_csum</b> will be used
      preferentially instead of <b>uninit_bg</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="metadata_csum_seed"><a class="permalink" href="#metadata_csum_seed"><b>metadata_csum_seed</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature allows the file system to store the metadata checksum seed in
      the superblock, which allows the administrator to change the UUID of a
      file system using the <b>metadata_csum</b> feature while it is
    mounted.</dd>
  <dt id="meta_bg"><a class="permalink" href="#meta_bg"><b>meta_bg</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature allows file systems to be resized on-line without
      explicitly needing to reserve space for growth in the size of the block
      group descriptors. This scheme is also used to resize file systems which
      are larger than 2^32 blocks. It is not recommended that this feature be
      set when a file system is created, since this alternate method of storing
      the block group descriptors will slow down the time needed to mount the
      file system, and newer kernels can automatically set this feature as
      necessary when doing an online resize and no more reserved space is
      available in the resize inode.</dd>
  <dt id="mmp"><a class="permalink" href="#mmp"><b>mmp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature provides multiple mount protection (MMP). MMP helps to
      protect the file system from being multiply mounted and is useful in
      shared storage environments.</dd>
  <dt id="project"><a class="permalink" href="#project"><b>project</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 feature provides project quota support. With this feature, the
      project ID of inode will be managed when the file system is mounted.</dd>
  <dt id="quota"><a class="permalink" href="#quota"><b>quota</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Create quota inodes (inode #3 for userquota and inode #4 for group quota)
      and set them in the superblock. With this feature, the quotas will be
      enabled automatically when the file system is mounted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Causes the quota files (i.e., user.quota and group.quota which existed in

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="resize_inode"><a class="permalink" href="#resize_inode"><b>resize_inode</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This file system feature indicates that space has been reserved so that the
      block group descriptor table can be extended while resizing a mounted file
      system. The online resize operation is carried out by the kernel,
      triggered by <b>resize2fs</b>(8). By default <b>mke2fs</b> will attempt to
      reserve enough space so that the file system may grow to 1024 times its
      initial size. This can be changed using the <b>resize</b> extended
    option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature requires that the <b>sparse_super</b> or <b>sparse_super2</b>
      feature be enabled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="sparse_super"><a class="permalink" href="#sparse_super"><b>sparse_super</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This file system feature is set on all modern ext2, ext3, and ext4 file
      systems. It indicates that backup copies of the superblock and block group
      descriptors are present only in a few block groups, not all of them.</dd>
  <dt id="sparse_super2"><a class="permalink" href="#sparse_super2"><b>sparse_super2</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This feature indicates that there will only be at most two backup
      superblocks and block group descriptors. The block groups used to store
      the backup superblock(s) and blockgroup descriptor(s) are stored in the
      superblock, but typically, one will be located at the beginning of block
      group #1, and one in the last block group in the file system. This feature
      is essentially a more extreme version of sparse_super and is designed to
      allow a much larger percentage of the disk to have contiguous blocks
      available for data files.</dd>
  <dt id="stable_inodes"><a class="permalink" href="#stable_inodes"><b>stable_inodes</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Marks the file system's inode numbers and UUID as stable.
      <b>resize2fs</b>(8) will not allow shrinking a file system with this
      feature, nor will <b>tune2fs</b>(8) allow changing its UUID. This feature
      allows the use of specialized encryption settings that make use of the
      inode numbers and UUID. Note that the <b>encrypt</b> feature still needs
      to be enabled separately. <b>stable_inodes</b> is a &quot;compat&quot;
      feature, so old kernels will allow it.</dd>
  <dt id="uninit_bg"><a class="permalink" href="#uninit_bg"><b>uninit_bg</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This ext4 file system feature indicates that the block group descriptors
      will be protected using checksums, making it safe for <b>mke2fs</b>(8) to
      create a file system without initializing all of the block groups. The
      kernel will keep a high watermark of unused inodes, and initialize inode
      tables and blocks lazily. This feature speeds up the time to check the
      file system using <b>e2fsck</b>(8), and it also speeds up the time
      required for <b>mke2fs</b>(8) to create the file system.</dd>
  <dt id="verity"><a class="permalink" href="#verity"><b>verity</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Enables support for verity protected files. Verity files are readonly, and
      their data is transparently verified against a Merkle tree hidden past the
      end of the file. Using the Merkle tree's root hash, a verity file can be
      efficiently authenticated, independent of the file's size.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature is most useful for authenticating important read-only files
      on read-write file systems. If the file system itself is read-only, then
      using dm-verity to authenticate the entire block device may provide much
      better security.</dd>

      barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables (default). This also requires an IO
      stack which can support barriers, and if jbd gets an error on a barrier
      write, it will disable barriers again with a warning. Write barriers
      enforce proper on-disk ordering of journal commits, making volatile disk
      write caches safe to use, at some performance penalty. If your disks are

  <dd>Maximum amount of time ext4 should wait for additional file system
      operations to be batch together with a synchronous write operation. Since
      a synchronous write operation is going to force a commit and then a wait
      for the I/O complete, it doesn't cost much, and can be a huge throughput
      win, we wait for a small amount of time to see if any other transactions
      can piggyback on the synchronous write. The algorithm used is designed to
      automatically tune for the speed of the disk, by measuring the amount of
      time (on average) that it takes to finish committing a transaction. Call
      this time the &quot;commit time&quot;. If the time that the transaction
      has been running is less than the commit time, ext4 will try sleeping for
      the commit time to see if other operations will join the transaction. The
      commit time is capped by the max_batch_time, which defaults to
      15000&#x00A0;&#x00B5;s (15&#x00A0;ms). This optimization can be turned off
      entirely by setting max_batch_time to 0.</dd>
  <dt id="min_batch_time="><a class="permalink" href="#min_batch_time="><b>min_batch_time=</b><i>usec</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This parameter sets the commit time (as described above) to be at least

        commit, in the default data=ordered mode, the data blocks of the new
        file are forced to disk before the rename() operation is committed. This
        provides roughly the same level of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the

  <dt id="block_validity"><a class="permalink" href="#block_validity"><b>block_validity</b>/<b>noblock_validity</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option enables/disables the in-kernel facility for tracking file
      system metadata blocks within internal data structures. This allows
      multi-block allocator and other routines to quickly locate extents which
      might overlap with file system metadata blocks. This option is intended

  <dt id="dioread_lock"><a class="permalink" href="#dioread_lock"><b>dioread_lock</b>/<b>dioread_nolock</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Controls whether or not ext4 should use the DIO read locking. If the
      dioread_nolock option is specified ext4 will allocate uninitialized extent
      before buffer write and convert the extent to initialized after IO
      completes. This approach allows ext4 code to avoid using inode mutex,
      which improves scalability on high speed storages. However this does not
      work with data journaling and dioread_nolock option will be ignored with
      kernel warning. Note that dioread_nolock code path is only used for

  <dd>This limits the size of the directories so that any attempt to expand them
      beyond the specified limit in kilobytes will cause an ENOSPC error. This
      is useful in memory-constrained environments, where a very large directory
      can cause severe performance problems or even provoke the Out Of Memory
      killer. (For example, if there is only 512&#x00A0;MB memory available, a
      176&#x00A0;MB directory may seriously cramp the system's style.)</dd>

  <dt id="nombcache"><a class="permalink" href="#nombcache"><b>nombcache</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option disables use of mbcache for extended attribute deduplication.
      On systems where extended attributes are rarely or never shared between
