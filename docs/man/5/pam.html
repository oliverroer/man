<p class="Pp">pam.conf, pam.d - PAM configuration files</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a <i>PAM</i> aware privilege granting application is started,
    it activates its attachment to the PAM-API. This activation performs a
    number of tasks, the most important being the reading of the configuration
    file(s): /etc/pam.conf. Alternatively and preferably, the configuration can
    be set by individual configuration files located in a pam.d directory. The
    presence of this directory will cause <b>Linux-PAM</b> to <i>ignore</i>
    /etc/pam.conf.</p>
<p class="Pp">These files list the <i>PAM</i>s that will do the authentication
    tasks required by this service, and the appropriate behavior of the PAM-API
    in the event that individual <i>PAM</i>s fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax of the /etc/pam.conf configuration file is as follows.
    The file is made up of a list of rules, each rule is typically placed on a
    single line, but may be extended with an escaped end of line: `\&lt;LF&gt;'.
    Comments are preceded with `#' marks and extend to the next end of line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The format of each rule is a space separated collection of tokens,
    the first three being case-insensitive:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b> service type control module-path module-arguments</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax of files contained in the /etc/pam.d/ directory, are
    identical except for the absence of any <i>service</i> field. In this case,
    the <i>service</i> is the name of the file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
    This filename must be in lower case.</p>
<p class="Pp">An important feature of <i>PAM</i>, is that a number of rules may
    be <i>stacked</i> to combine the services of a number of PAMs for a given
    authentication task.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>service</i> is typically the familiar name of the
    corresponding application: <i>login</i> and <i>su</i> are good examples. The
    <i>service</i>-name, <i>other</i>, is reserved for giving <i>default</i>
    rules. Only lines that mention the current service (or in the absence of
    such, the <i>other</i> entries) will be associated with the given
    service-application.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>type</i> is the management group that the rule corresponds
    to. It is used to specify which of the management groups the subsequent
    module is to be associated with. Valid entries are:</p>
<p class="Pp">account</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">this module type performs non-authentication based
  account management. It is typically used to restrict/permit access to a
  service based on the time of day, currently available system resources
  (maximum number of users) or perhaps the location of the applicant user --
  'root' login only on the console.</div>
<p class="Pp">auth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">this module type provides two aspects of authenticating
  the user. Firstly, it establishes that the user is who they claim to be, by
  instructing the application to prompt the user for a password or other means
  of identification. Secondly, the module can grant group membership or other
  privileges through its credential granting properties.</div>
<p class="Pp">password</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">this module type is required for updating the
  authentication token associated with the user. Typically, there is one module
  for each 'challenge/response' based authentication (auth) type.</div>
<p class="Pp">session</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">this module type is associated with doing things that
  need to be done for the user before/after they can be given service. Such
  things include the logging of information concerning the opening/closing of
  some data exchange with a user, mounting directories, etc.</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>type</i> value from the list above is prepended with a
    <i>-</i> character the PAM library will not log to the system log if it is
    not possible to load the module because it is missing in the system. This
    can be useful especially for modules which are not always installed on the
    system and are not required for correct authentication and authorization of
    the login session.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third field, <i>control</i>, indicates the behavior of the
    PAM-API should the module fail to succeed in its authentication task. There
    are two types of syntax for this control field: the simple one has a single
    simple keyword; the more complicated one involves a square-bracketed
    selection of <i>value=action</i> pairs.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the simple (historical) syntax valid <i>control</i> values
    are:</p>
<p class="Pp">required</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to the PAM-API
  returning failure but only after the remaining <i>stacked</i> modules (for
  this <i>service</i> and <i>type</i>) have been invoked.</div>
<p class="Pp">requisite</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">like <i>required</i>, however, in the case that such a
  module returns a failure, control is directly returned to the application or
  to the superior PAM stack. The return value is that associated with the first
  required or requisite module to fail. Note, this flag can be used to protect
  against the possibility of a user getting the opportunity to enter a password
  over an unsafe medium. It is conceivable that such behavior might inform an
  attacker of valid accounts on a system. This possibility should be weighed
  against the not insignificant concerns of exposing a sensitive password in a
  hostile environment.</div>
<p class="Pp">sufficient</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">if such a module succeeds and no prior <i>required</i>
  module has failed the PAM framework returns success to the application or to
  the superior PAM stack immediately without calling any further modules in the
  stack. A failure of a <i>sufficient</i> module is ignored and processing of
  the PAM module stack continues unaffected.</div>
<p class="Pp">optional</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">the success or failure of this module is only important
  if it is the only module in the stack associated with this
  <i>service</i>+<i>type</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">include</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">include all lines of given type from the configuration
  file specified as an argument to this control.</div>
<p class="Pp">substack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">include all lines of given type from the configuration
  file specified as an argument to this control. This differs from
  <i>include</i> in that evaluation of the <i>done</i> and <i>die</i> actions in
  a substack does not cause skipping the rest of the complete module stack, but
  only of the substack. Jumps in a substack also can not make evaluation jump
  out of it, and the whole substack is counted as one module when the jump is
  done in a parent stack. The <i>reset</i> action will reset the state of a
  module stack to the state it was in as of beginning of the substack
  evaluation.</div>
<p class="Pp">For the more complicated syntax valid <i>control</i> values have
    the following form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
      [value1=action1 value2=action2 ...]
<br/>
    </pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Where <i>valueN</i> corresponds to the return code from the
    function invoked in the module for which the line is defined. It is selected
    from one of these: <i>success</i>, <i>open_err</i>, <i>symbol_err</i>,
    <i>service_err</i>, <i>system_err</i>, <i>buf_err</i>, <i>perm_denied</i>,
    <i>auth_err</i>, <i>cred_insufficient</i>, <i>authinfo_unavail</i>,
    <i>user_unknown</i>, <i>maxtries</i>, <i>new_authtok_reqd</i>,
    <i>acct_expired</i>, <i>session_err</i>, <i>cred_unavail</i>,
    <i>cred_expired</i>, <i>cred_err</i>, <i>no_module_data</i>,
    <i>conv_err</i>, <i>authtok_err</i>, <i>authtok_recover_err</i>,
    <i>authtok_lock_busy</i>, <i>authtok_disable_aging</i>, <i>try_again</i>,
    <i>ignore</i>, <i>abort</i>, <i>authtok_expired</i>, <i>module_unknown</i>,
    <i>bad_item</i>, <i>conv_again</i>, <i>incomplete</i>, and
  <i>default</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last of these, <i>default</i>, implies 'all <i>valueN</i>'s
    not mentioned explicitly. Note, the full list of PAM errors is available in
    /usr/include/security/_pam_types.h. The <i>actionN</i> can take one of the
    following forms:</p>
<p class="Pp">ignore</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">when used with a stack of modules, the module's return
  status will not contribute to the return code the application obtains.</div>
<p class="Pp">bad</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">this action indicates that the return code should be
  thought of as indicative of the module failing. If this module is the first in
  the stack to fail, its status value will be used for that of the whole stack.
  This is the default action for all return codes.</div>
<p class="Pp">die</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">equivalent to <i>bad</i> with the side effect of
  terminating the module stack and PAM immediately returning to the
  application.</div>
<p class="Pp">ok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">this tells PAM that the administrator thinks this return
  code should contribute directly to the return code of the full stack of
  modules. In other words, if the former state of the stack would lead to a
  return of <i>PAM_SUCCESS</i>, the module's return code will override this
  value. Note, if the former state of the stack holds some value that is
  indicative of a modules failure, this 'ok' value will not be used to override
  that value.</div>
<p class="Pp">done</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">equivalent to <i>ok</i> with the side effect of
  terminating the module stack and PAM immediately returning to the application
  unless there was a non-ignored module failure before.</div>
<p class="Pp">N (an unsigned integer)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">jump over the next N modules in the stack. Note that N
  equal to 0 is not allowed, it would be treated as <i>ignore</i> in such case.
  The side effect depends on the PAM function call: for <i>pam_authenticate</i>,
  <i>pam_acct_mgmt</i>, <i>pam_chauthtok</i>, and <i>pam_open_session</i> it is
  <i>ignore</i>; for <i>pam_setcred</i> and <i>pam_close_session</i> it is one
  of <i>ignore</i>, <i>ok</i>, or <i>bad</i> depending on the module's return
  value.</div>
<p class="Pp">reset</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">clear all memory of the state of the module stack and
  start again with the next stacked module.</div>
<p class="Pp">If a return code's action is not specifically defined via a
    <i>valueN</i> token, and the <i>default</i> value is not specified, that
    return code's action defaults to <i>bad</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of the four keywords: required; requisite; sufficient; and
    optional, have an equivalent expression in terms of the [...] syntax. They
    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp">required</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore
  default=bad]</div>
<p class="Pp">requisite</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore
  default=die]</div>
<p class="Pp">sufficient</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">[success=done new_authtok_reqd=done default=ignore]</div>
<p class="Pp">optional</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok default=ignore]</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>module-path</i> is either the full filename of the PAM to be
    used by the application (it begins with a '/'), or a relative pathname from
    the default module location: /lib/security/ or /lib64/security/, depending
    on the architecture.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>module-arguments</i> are a space separated list of tokens that
    can be used to modify the specific behavior of the given PAM. Such arguments
    will be documented for each individual module. Note, if you wish to include
    spaces in an argument, you should surround that argument with square
    brackets.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
    squid auth required pam_mysql.so user=passwd_query passwd=mada \
<br/>
          db=eminence [query=select user_name from internet_service \
<br/>
          where user_name='%u' and password=PASSWORD('%p') and \
<br/>
        service='web_proxy']
<br/>
    </pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When using this convention, you can include `[' characters inside
    the string, and if you wish to include a `]' character inside the string
    that will survive the argument parsing, you should use `\]'. In other
  words:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
    [..[..\]..]    --&gt;   ..[..]..
<br/>
    </pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Any line in (one of) the configuration file(s), that is not
    formatted correctly, will generally tend (erring on the side of caution) to
    make the authentication process fail. A corresponding error is written to
    the system log files with a call to <b>syslog</b>(3).</p>
<p class="Pp">More flexible than the single configuration file is it to
    configure libpam via the contents of pam.d directories. In this case the
    directories are filled with files each of which has a filename equal to a
    service-name (in lower-case): it is the personal configuration file for the
    named service.</p>
<p class="Pp">Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the
    system directory /usr/lib/pam.d/ or a configurable vendor specific directory
    instead of the machine configuration directory /etc/pam.d/. If no machine
    configuration file is found, the vendor-supplied file is used. All files in
    /etc/pam.d/ override files with the same name in other directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax of each file in pam.d is similar to that of the
    /etc/pam.conf file and is made up of lines of the following form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>type  control  module-path  module-arguments
<br/>
    </pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The only difference being that the service-name is not present.
    The service-name is of course the name of the given configuration file. For
    example, /etc/pam.d/login contains the configuration for the <b>login</b>
    service.</p>
