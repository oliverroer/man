<p class="Pp">time.conf - configuration file for the pam_time module</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but
    instead it restricts access to a system and or specific applications at
    various times of the day and on specific days or over various terminal
    lines. This module can be configured to deny access to (individual) users
    based on their name, the time of day, the day of week, the service they are
    applying for and their terminal from which they are making their
  request.</p>
<p class="Pp">For this module to function correctly there must be a correctly
    formatted /etc/security/time.conf file present. White spaces are ignored and
    lines maybe extended with '\' (escaped newlines). Text following a '#' is
    ignored to the end of the line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax of the lines is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>services</i>;<i>ttys</i>;<i>users</i>;<i>times</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In words, each rule occupies a line, terminated with a newline or
    the beginning of a comment; a '<b>#</b>'. It contains four fields separated
    with semicolons, '<b>;</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first field, the <i>services</i> field, is a logic list of PAM
    service names that the rule applies to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second field, the <i>tty</i> field, is a logic list of
    terminal names that this rule applies to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third field, the <i>users</i> field, is a logic list of users
    or a netgroup of users to whom this rule applies.</p>
<p class="Pp">A logic list namely means individual tokens that are optionally
    prefixed with '!' (logical not) and separated with '&amp;' (logical and) and
    '|' (logical or).</p>
<p class="Pp">For these items the simple wildcard '*' may be used only once.
    With netgroups no wildcards or logic operators are allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>times</i> field is used to indicate the times at which this
    rule applies. The format here is a logic list of day/time-range entries. The
    days are specified by a sequence of two character entries, MoTuSa for
    example is Monday Tuesday and Saturday. Note that repeated days are unset
    MoMo = no day, and MoWk = all weekdays bar Monday. The two character
    combinations accepted are Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su Wk Wd Al, the last two being
    week-end days and all 7 days of the week respectively. As a final example,
    AlFr means all days except Friday.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each day/time-range can be prefixed with a '!' to indicate
    &quot;anything but&quot;. The time-range part is two 24-hour times HHMM,
    separated by a hyphen, indicating the start and finish time (if the finish
    time is smaller than the start time it is deemed to apply on the following
    day).</p>
<p class="Pp">For a rule to be active, ALL of service+ttys+users must be
    satisfied by the applying process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, currently there is no daemon enforcing the end of a session.
    This needs to be remedied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Poorly formatted rules are logged as errors using
    <b>syslog</b>(3).</p>

<p class="Pp">These are some example lines which might be specified in
