<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">shadow is a file which contains the password information for the
    system's accounts and optional aging information.</p>
<p class="Pp">This file must not be readable by regular users if password
    security is to be maintained.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line of this file contains 9 fields, separated by colons
    (&#x201C;:&#x201D;), in the following order:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>login name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">It must be a valid account name, which exist on the
  system.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>encrypted password</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are
  required to authenticate as the specified login name. However, some
  applications which read the /etc/shadow file may decide not to permit any
  access at all if the password field is empty.
<p class="Pp">A password field which starts with an exclamation mark means that
    the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line represent the
    password field before the password was locked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Refer to <b>crypt</b>(3) for details on how this string is
    interpreted.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the password field contains some string that is not a valid
    result of <b>crypt</b>(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able to
    use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the system by other
    means).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>date of last password change</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The date of the last password change, expressed as the
  number of days since Jan 1, 1970 00:00 UTC.
<p class="Pp">The value 0 has a special meaning, which is that the user should
    change her password the next time she will log in the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">An empty field means that password aging features are
  disabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>minimum password age</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The minimum password age is the number of days the user
  will have to wait before she will be allowed to change her password again.
<p class="Pp">An empty field and value 0 mean that there is no minimum password
    age.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>maximum password age</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum password age is the number of days after
  which the user will have to change her password.
<p class="Pp">After this number of days is elapsed, the password may still be
    valid. The user should be asked to change her password the next time she
    will log in.</p>
<p class="Pp">An empty field means that there are no maximum password age, no
    password warning period, and no password inactivity period (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum password
    age, the user cannot change her password.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>password warning period</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of days before a password is going to expire
  (see the maximum password age above) during which the user should be warned.
<p class="Pp">An empty field and value 0 mean that there are no password warning
    period.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>password inactivity period</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of days after a password has expired (see the
  maximum password age above) during which the password should still be accepted
  (and the user should update her password during the next login).
<p class="Pp">After expiration of the password and this expiration period is
    elapsed, no login is possible for the user. The user should contact her
    administrator.</p>
<p class="Pp">An empty field means that there are no enforcement of an
    inactivity period.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>account expiration date</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The date of expiration of the account, expressed as the
  number of days since Jan 1, 1970 00:00 UTC.
<p class="Pp">Note that an account expiration differs from a password
    expiration. In case of an account expiration, the user shall not be allowed
    to login. In case of a password expiration, the user is not allowed to login
    using her password.</p>
<p class="Pp">An empty field means that the account will never expire.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value 0 should not be used as it is interpreted as either an
    account with no expiration, or as an expiration on Jan 1, 1970.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>reserved field</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This field is reserved for future use.</div>
