<p class="Pp">The <i>pam_namespace.so</i> module allows setup of private
    namespaces with polyinstantiated directories. Directories can be
    polyinstantiated based on user name or, in the case of SELinux, user name,
    sensitivity level or complete security context. If an executable script
    /etc/security/namespace.init exists, it is used to initialize the namespace
    every time an instance directory is set up and mounted. The script receives
    the polyinstantiated directory path and the instance directory path as its
    arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The /etc/security/namespace.conf file specifies which directories
    are polyinstantiated, how they are polyinstantiated, how instance
    directories would be named, and any users for whom polyinstantiation would
    not be performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When someone logs in, the file namespace.conf is scanned. Comments
    are marked by <i>#</i> characters. Each non comment line represents one
    polyinstantiated directory. The fields are separated by spaces but can be
    quoted by <i>&quot;</i> characters also escape sequences <i>\b</i>,
    <i>\n</i>, and <i>\t</i> are recognized. The fields are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>polydir</i> <i>instance_prefix</i> <i>method</i>
    <i>list_of_uids</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The first field, <i>polydir</i>, is the absolute pathname of the
    directory to polyinstantiate. The special string <i>$HOME</i> is replaced
    with the user's home directory, and <i>$USER</i> with the username. This
    field cannot be blank.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second field, <i>instance_prefix</i> is the string prefix used
    to build the pathname for the instantiation of &lt;polydir&gt;. Depending on
    the polyinstantiation <i>method</i> it is then appended with &quot;instance
    differentiation string&quot; to generate the final instance directory path.
    This directory is created if it did not exist already, and is then bind
    mounted on the &lt;polydir&gt; to provide an instance of &lt;polydir&gt;
    based on the &lt;method&gt; column. The special string <i>$HOME</i> is
    replaced with the user's home directory, and <i>$USER</i> with the username.
    This field cannot be blank.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third field, <i>method</i>, is the method used for
    polyinstantiation. It can take these values; &quot;user&quot; for
    polyinstantiation based on user name, &quot;level&quot; for
    polyinstantiation based on process MLS level and user name,
    &quot;context&quot; for polyinstantiation based on process security context
    and user name, &quot;tmpfs&quot; for mounting tmpfs filesystem as an
    instance dir, and &quot;tmpdir&quot; for creating temporary directory as an
    instance dir which is removed when the user's session is closed. Methods
    &quot;context&quot; and &quot;level&quot; are only available with SELinux.
    This field cannot be blank.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fourth field, <i>list_of_uids</i>, is a comma separated list
    of user names for whom the polyinstantiation is not performed. If left
    blank, polyinstantiation will be performed for all users. If the list is
    preceded with a single &quot;~&quot; character, polyinstantiation is
    performed only for users in the list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>method</i> field can contain also following optional flags
    separated by <i>:</i> characters.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>create</i>=<i>mode</i>,<i>owner</i>,<i>group</i> - create the
    polyinstantiated directory. The mode, owner and group parameters are
    optional. The default for mode is determined by umask, the default owner is
    the user whose session is opened, the default group is the primary group of
    the user.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>iscript</i>=<i>path</i> - path to the instance directory init
    script. The base directory for relative paths is
  /etc/security/namespace.d.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>noinit</i> - instance directory init script will not be
    executed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>shared</i> - the instance directories for &quot;context&quot;
    and &quot;level&quot; methods will not contain the user name and will be
    shared among all users.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>mntopts</i>=<i>value</i> - value of this flag is passed to the
    mount call when the tmpfs mount is done. It allows for example the
    specification of the maximum size of the tmpfs instance that is created by
    the mount call. In addition to options specified in the <b>tmpfs</b>(5)
    manual the <i>nosuid</i>, <i>noexec</i>, and <i>nodev</i> flags can be used
    to respectively disable setuid bit effect, disable running executables, and
    disable devices to be interpreted on the mounted tmpfs filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">The directory where polyinstantiated instances are to be created,
    must exist and must have, by default, the mode of 0000. The requirement that
    the instance parent be of mode 0000 can be overridden with the command line
    option <i>ignore_instance_parent_mode</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In case of context or level polyinstantiation the SELinux context
    which is used for polyinstantiation is the context used for executing a new
    process as obtained by getexeccon. This context must be set by the calling
    application or pam_selinux.so module. If this context is not set the
    polyinstatiation will be based just on user name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;instance differentiation string&quot; is &lt;user
    name&gt; for &quot;user&quot; method and &lt;user name&gt;_&lt;raw directory
    context&gt; for &quot;context&quot; and &quot;level&quot; methods. If the
    whole string is too long the end of it is replaced with md5sum of itself.
    Also when command line option <i>gen_hash</i> is used the whole string is
    replaced with md5sum of itself.</p>
