  <dd>This directory contains the files and subdirectories for kernel variables
      related to filesystems.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr</i> and <i>/proc/sys/fs/aio-nr</i> (since Linux
    2.6.4)</dt>
  <dd><i>aio-nr</i> is the running total of the number of events specified by
      <b>io_setup</b>(2) calls for all currently active AIO contexts. If
      <i>aio-nr</i> reaches <i>aio-max-nr</i>, then <b>io_setup</b>(2) will fail
      with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>. Raising <i>aio-max-nr</i> does not result in
      the preallocation or resizing of any kernel data structures.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc</i></dt>
  <dd>Documentation for files in this directory can be found in the Linux kernel
      source in the file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.rst</i> (or in
      <i>Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt</i> on older kernels).</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/dentry-state</i> (since Linux 2.2)</dt>
  <dd>This file contains information about the status of the directory cache
      (dcache). The file contains six numbers, <i>nr_dentry</i>,
      <i>nr_unused</i>, <i>age_limit</i> (age in seconds), <i>want_pages</i>
      (pages requested by system) and two dummy values.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><i>nr_dentry</i> is the number of allocated dentries (dcache entries).
      This field is unused in Linux 2.2.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><i>nr_unused</i> is the number of unused dentries.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><i>age_limit</i> is the age in seconds after which dcache entries can be
      reclaimed when memory is short.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd><i>want_pages</i> is nonzero when the kernel has called
      shrink_dcache_pages() and the dcache isn't pruned yet.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable</i></dt>
  <dd>This file can be used to disable or enable the <i>dnotify</i> interface
      described in <b>fcntl</b>(2) on a system-wide basis. A value of 0 in this
      file disables the interface, and a value of 1 enables it.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max</i></dt>
  <dd>This file shows the maximum number of cached disk quota entries. On some
      (2.4) systems, it is not present. If the number of free cached disk quota
      entries is very low and you have some awesome number of simultaneous
      system users, you might want to raise the limit.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr</i></dt>
  <dd>This file shows the number of allocated disk quota entries and the number
      of free disk quota entries.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/</i> (since Linux 2.6.28)</dt>
  <dd>This directory contains the file <i>max_user_watches</i>, which can be
      used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the <i>epoll</i>
      interface. For further details, see <b>epoll</b>(7).</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i></dt>
  <dd>This file defines a system-wide limit on the number of open files for all
      processes. System calls that fail when encountering this limit fail with
      the error <b>ENFILE</b>. (See also <b>setrlimit</b>(2), which can be used
      by a process to set the per-process limit, <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE</b>, on the
      number of files it may open.) If you get lots of error messages in the
      kernel log about running out of file handles (open file descriptions)
      (look for &quot;VFS: file-max limit &lt;number&gt; reached&quot;), try
      increasing this value:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>echo 100000 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Privileged processes (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) can override the
      <i>file-max</i> limit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/file-nr</i></dt>
  <dd>This (read-only) file contains three numbers: the number of allocated file
      handles (i.e., the number of open file descriptions; see <b>open</b>(2));
      the number of free file handles; and the maximum number of file handles
      (i.e., the same value as <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i>). If the number of
      allocated file handles is close to the maximum, you should consider
      increasing the maximum. Before Linux 2.6, the kernel allocated file
      handles dynamically, but it didn't free them again. Instead the free file
      handles were kept in a list for reallocation; the &quot;free file
      handles&quot; value indicates the size of that list. A large number of
      free file handles indicates that there was a past peak in the usage of
      open file handles. Since Linux 2.6, the kernel does deallocate freed file
      handles, and the &quot;free file handles&quot; value is always zero.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max</i> (only present until Linux 2.2)</dt>
  <dd>This file contains the maximum number of in-memory inodes. This value
      should be 3&#x2013;4 times larger than the value in <i>file-max</i>, since
      <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i> and network sockets also need an inode to
      handle them. When you regularly run out of inodes, you need to increase
      this value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Starting with Linux 2.4, there is no longer a static limit on the number
      of inodes, and this file is removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr</i></dt>
  <dd>This file contains the first two values from <i>inode-state</i>.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/inode-state</i></dt>
  <dd>This file contains seven numbers: <i>nr_inodes</i>, <i>nr_free_inodes</i>,
      <i>preshrink</i>, and four dummy values (always zero).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><i>nr_inodes</i> is the number of inodes the system has allocated.
      <i>nr_free_inodes</i> represents the number of free inodes.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><i>preshrink</i> is nonzero when the <i>nr_inodes</i> &gt;
      <i>inode-max</i> and the system needs to prune the inode list instead of
      allocating more; since Linux 2.4, this field is a dummy value (always
      zero).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/inotify/</i> (since Linux 2.6.13)</dt>
  <dd>This directory contains files <i>max_queued_events</i>,
      <i>max_user_instances</i>, and <i>max_user_watches</i>, that can be used
      to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the <i>inotify</i>
      interface. For further details, see <b>inotify</b>(7).</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time</i></dt>
  <dd>This file specifies the grace period that the kernel grants to a process
      holding a file lease (<b>fcntl</b>(2)) after it has sent a signal to that
      process notifying it that another process is waiting to open the file. If
      the lease holder does not remove or downgrade the lease within this grace
      period, the kernel forcibly breaks the lease.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable</i></dt>
  <dd>This file can be used to enable or disable file leases (<b>fcntl</b>(2))
      on a system-wide basis. If this file contains the value 0, leases are
      disabled. A nonzero value enables leases.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/mount-max</i> (since Linux 4.9)</dt>
  <dd>The value in this file specifies the maximum number of mounts that may
      exist in a mount namespace. The default value in this file is
    100,000.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/</i> (since Linux 2.6.6)</dt>
  <dd>This directory contains files <i>msg_max</i>, <i>msgsize_max</i>, and
      <i>queues_max</i>, controlling the resources used by POSIX message queues.
      See <b>mq_overview</b>(7) for details.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/nr_open</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)</dt>
  <dd>This file imposes a ceiling on the value to which the <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE</b>
      resource limit can be raised (see <b>getrlimit</b>(2)). This ceiling is
      enforced for both unprivileged and privileged process. The default value
      in this file is 1048576. (Before Linux 2.6.25, the ceiling for
      <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE</b> was hard-coded to the same value.)</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</i> and <i>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</i></dt>
  <dd>These files allow you to change the value of the fixed UID and GID. The
      default is 65534. Some filesystems support only 16-bit UIDs and GIDs,
      although in Linux UIDs and GIDs are 32 bits. When one of these filesystems
      is mounted with writes enabled, any UID or GID that would exceed 65535 is
      translated to the overflow value before being written to disk.</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</i> (since Linux 2.6.35)</dt>
  <dd>See <b>pipe</b>(7).</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard</i> (since Linux 4.5)</dt>

  <dd>See <b>pipe</b>(7).</dd>
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_fifos</i> (since Linux 4.19)</dt>
  <dd>The value in this file is/can be set to one of the following:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>Writing to FIFOs is unrestricted.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks</i> (since Linux 3.6)</dt>
  <dd>When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are placed on the
      creation of hard links (i.e., this is the historical behavior before Linux
      3.6). When the value in this file is 1, a hard link can be created to a
      target file only if one of the following conditions is true:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>The calling process has the <b>CAP_FOWNER</b> capability in its user
      namespace and the file UID has a mapping in the namespace.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>The filesystem UID of the process creating the link matches the owner
      (UID) of the target file (as described in <b>credentials</b>(7), a
      process's filesystem UID is normally the same as its effective UID).</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>All of the following conditions are true:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>

  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>the target file does not have both its set-group-ID and group-executable
      mode bits enabled; and</dd>

</dl>
</div>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The default value in this file is 0. Setting the value to 1 prevents a
      longstanding class of security issues caused by hard-link-based
      time-of-check, time-of-use races, most commonly seen in world-writable
      directories such as <i>/tmp</i>. The common method of exploiting this flaw
      is to cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link (i.e., a
      root process follows a hard link created by another user). Additionally,
      on systems without separated partitions, this stops unauthorized users
      from &quot;pinning&quot; vulnerable set-user-ID and set-group-ID files
      against being upgraded by the administrator, or linking to special
    files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      doesn't own in world-writable sticky directories, unless the regular file
      is owned by the owner of the directory.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks</i> (since Linux 3.6)</dt>
  <dd>When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are placed on following
      symbolic links (i.e., this is the historical behavior before Linux 3.6).
      When the value in this file is 1, symbolic links are followed only in the
      following circumstances:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>the filesystem UID of the process following the link matches the owner

      process's filesystem UID is normally the same as its effective UID);</dd>

      longstanding class of security issues based on time-of-check, time-of-use
      races when accessing symbolic links.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> (since Linux 2.6.13)</dt>
  <dd>The value in this file is assigned to a process's &quot;dumpable&quot;
      flag in the circumstances described in <b>prctl</b>(2). In effect, the
      value in this file determines whether core dump files are produced for
      set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries. The
      &quot;dumpable&quot; setting also affects the ownership of files in a
      process's <i>/proc/</i>pid directory, as described above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Three different integer values can be specified:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>0&#x00A0;(default)</i></dt>
  <dd>This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior. A core dump
      will not be produced for a process which has changed credentials (by
      calling <b>seteuid</b>(2), <b>setgid</b>(2), or similar, or by executing a
      set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose binary does not have read
      permission enabled.</dd>
  <dt><i>1&#x00A0;(&quot;debug&quot;)</i></dt>
  <dd>All processes dump core when possible. (Reasons why a process might
      nevertheless not dump core are described in <b>core</b>(5).) The core dump
      is owned by the filesystem user ID of the dumping process and no security
      is applied. This is intended for system debugging situations only: this
      mode is insecure because it allows unprivileged users to examine the
      memory contents of privileged processes.</dd>
  <dt><i>2&#x00A0;(&quot;suidsafe&quot;)</i></dt>
  <dd>Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see &quot;0&quot; above) is
      dumped readable by root only. This allows the user to remove the core dump
      file but not to read it. For security reasons core dumps in this mode will
      not overwrite one another or other files. This mode is appropriate when
      administrators are attempting to debug problems in a normal
    environment.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Additionally, since Linux 3.6, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> must
      either be an absolute pathname or a pipe command, as detailed in
      <b>core</b>(5). Warnings will be written to the kernel log if
      <i>core_pattern</i> does not follow these rules, and no core dump will be
      produced.</dd>
