<p class="Pp">apt-transport-mirror - APT transport for more automated mirror
    selection</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This APT transport isn't implementing a protocol to access local
    or remote repositories on its own, but acquires a mirrorlist and redirects
    all requests to the mirror(s) picked from this list, accessing them via
    other transports like <b>apt-transport-http</b>(1). The basic functionality
    has been available since apt 0.7.24, but was undocumented until apt 1.6
    which contained a complete rework of the transport and its supported
    features. Note that a transport is never called directly by a user but used
    by APT tools based on user configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the acquisition of a file via a mirror fails, the method
    ensures that another possible mirror from the list is automatically tried
    until either the file is retrieved or no mirror is left in the list,
    transparently handling server downtimes and similar problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security implications of the transport depend on the security
    considerations associated with the transport used to acquire the mirrorlist
    and the transports involved in accessing the chosen mirror(s) by the
    transport.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This transport has no configuration options at present. The mirror
    selection is based entirely on the mirrors offered in the mirrorlist and the
    files APT needs to acquire.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mirrorlist_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Mirrorlist_format">Mirrorlist
  format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A mirrorlist contains one or more lines each specifying a URI for
    a mirror. Empty lines and those starting with a hash character (#) are
    ignored. A URI always starts with a URI scheme which defines the transport
    used for this mirror. If for example the URI starts with http:, the
    responsible transport is <b>apt-transport-http</b>(1) which might have
    specific requirements for the format of the remaining part of the URI.</p>
<p class="Pp">Metadata about a mirror can be given on the same line, separated
    from the URI by a tab. Multiple items of metadata can themselves be
    separated by either tabs or spaces. (This is an advanced feature only
    available with apt &gt;= 1.6. Earlier apt versions will fail to parse
    mirrorlists using this feature.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Since apt 1.6 the use of compressed mirrorlists is also supported.
    Note that the filename of the mirrorlist must specify the compression
    algorithm used; there is no auto-detection based on file contents.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mirror_selection_by_metadata"><a class="permalink" href="#Mirror_selection_by_metadata">Mirror
  selection by metadata</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As specified in the format, a mirror can have additional metadata
    attached to prevent a mirror from being selected for acquiring a file not
    matching this metadata. This way the mirrorlist can e.g. contain partial
    mirrors serving only certain architectures and APT will automatically choose
    a different mirror for files requiring an unlisted architecture. Supported
    are limits for the architecture (arch), codename of the release (codename),
    component of the repository the file is in (component), language the file
    applies to (lang), suite name of the release (suite) and type of the file
    (type).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Fallback_order_for_mirrors"><a class="permalink" href="#Fallback_order_for_mirrors">Fallback
  order for mirrors</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If no priority is given for a mirror via the metadata key
    priority, the order in which mirrors are contacted is random. If a certain
    set of mirrors should be tried first before any of another set is tried, a
    priority can be explicitly set. The mirrors with the lowest number are tried
    first. Mirrors which have no explicit priority set default to the highest
    possible number and are therefore tried last. The choice between mirrors
    with the same priority is again random.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Allowed_transports_in_a_mirrorlist"><a class="permalink" href="#Allowed_transports_in_a_mirrorlist">Allowed
  transports in a mirrorlist</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The availability and choice of transports in a mirrorlist is
    limited by how the APT client is accessing the mirrorlist. If a local
    transport like file or copy is used, the mirrorlist can also include local
    sources, while a mirrorlist accessed via http can not. Additionally, a
    mirrorlist can not contain a mirrorlist or other wrapping transports (like
    apt-transport-tor). See the documentation of these transports on how to use
    them with the mirror method.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that apt versions before 1.6 do not support any other
    transport than http.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Basic_example"><a class="permalink" href="#Basic_example">Basic
  example</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A basic mirrorlist example supported by all apt versions with a
    mirror method (&gt;= 0.7.24) in which the client will pick any of the three
    mirrors:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/
http://deb.debian.org/debian/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Assuming a file with this content is stored as
    /etc/apt/mirrorlist.txt on your machine it can be used like this in
    <b>sources.list</b>(5) (since apt 1.6):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deb mirror+file:/etc/apt/mirrorlist.txt bookworm main</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">All versions of the mirror method support a mirrorlist accessible
    via HTTP, so assuming it is available at http://apt.example.org/mirror.lst
    the sources.list entry from above could instead be written as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>deb mirror://apt.example.org/mirror.lst bookworm main</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that since apt 1.6 the use of mirror+http should be preferred
    over mirror for uniformity. The functionality is the same.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Example_with_metadata"><a class="permalink" href="#Example_with_metadata">Example
  with metadata-enhanced mirror selection</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As explained in the format definition apt versions before 1.6 do
    not support this and will fail parsing the mirrorlist. The example
    mirrorlist is intentionally complicated to show some aspects of the
    selection. The following setup is assumed: The first mirror is a local
    mirror accessible via the file method, but potentially incomplete. The
    second mirror has a great connection, but is a partial mirror insofar as it
    only contains files related to the architectures amd64 and all. The
    remaining mirrors are average mirrors which should be contacted only if the
    earlier ones didn't work.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>file:/srv/local/debian/mirror/	priority:1 type:index
http://partial.example.org/mirror/	priority:2 arch:amd64 arch:all type:deb
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/	type:deb
http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/	type:deb
https://deb.debian.org/debian/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In this setup with this mirrorlist the first mirror will be used
    to download all index files assuming the mirrorlist itself is accessed via a
    local transport like file. If it isn't, if the mirror is otherwise
    inaccessible or if it does not contain the requested file another mirror
    will be used to acquire the file, chosen depending on the type of the file:
    An index file will be served by the last mirror in the list, while a package
    of architecture amd64 is served by the second and those of e.g. architecture
    i386 by one of the last three.</p>
