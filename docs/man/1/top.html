<p class="Pp">The <b>top</b> program provides a dynamic real-time view of a
    running system. It can display<b> system</b> summary information as well as
    a list of <b>processes</b> or <b>threads</b> currently being managed by the
    Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the types,
    order and size of information displayed for processes are all user
    configurable and that configuration can be made persistent across
  restarts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The program provides a limited interactive interface for process
    manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal
    configuration &#x00A0;--&#x00A0; encompassing every aspect of its operation.
    And while <b>top</b> is referred to throughout this document, you are free
    to name the program anything you wish. That new name, possibly an alias,
    will then be reflected on top's display and used when reading and writing a
    configuration file.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Operation"><a class="permalink" href="#Operation">Operation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When operating top, the two most important keys are the help (h or
    ?) key and quit (`q') key. Alternatively, you could simply use the
    traditional interrupt key (^C) when you're done.</p>
<p class="Pp">When started for the first time, you'll be presented with these
    traditional elements on the main top screen: 1) Summary Area; 2)
    Fields/Columns Header; 3) Task Area. Each of these will be explored in the
    sections that follow. There is also an Input/Message line between the
    Summary Area and Columns Header which needs no further explanation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main top screen is <i>generally</i> quite adaptive to changes
    in terminal dimensions under X-Windows. Other top screens may be less so,
    especially those with static text. It ultimately depends, however, on your
    particular window manager and terminal emulator. There may be occasions when
    their view of terminal size and current contents differs from top's view,
    which is always based on operating system calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">Following any re-size operation, if a top screen is corrupted,
    appears incomplete or disordered, simply typing something innocuous like a
    punctuation character or cursor motion key will usually restore it. In
    extreme cases, the following sequence almost certainly will:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
       <i>key/cmd  objective </i>
<br/>
       ^Z       <b>suspend</b> top
<br/>
       fg       <b>resume</b> top
<br/>
       &lt;Left&gt;   force a screen <b>redraw</b> (if necessary)</pre>
<p class="Pp">But if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you
    could try. Insert this command after top has been suspended but before
    resuming it.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
       <i>key/cmd  objective </i>
<br/>
       reset    restore your <b>terminal settings</b></pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: the width of top's display will be limited to 512
    positions. Displaying all fields requires approximately 250 characters.
    Remaining screen width is usually allocated to any variable width columns
    currently visible. The variable width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in
    topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields. Actual output width may also be influenced
    by the -w switch, which is discussed in topic 1. COMMAND-LINE Options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lastly, some of top's screens or functions require the use of
    cursor motion keys like the standard arrow keys plus the Home, End, PgUp and
    PgDn keys. If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the
    following combinations are accepted as alternatives:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
      <i> key      equivalent-keys </i>
<br/>
       Left     alt +<b> h </b>
<br/>
       Down     alt +<b> j </b>
<br/>
       Up       alt +<b> k </b>
<br/>
       Right    alt +<b> l </b>
<br/>
       Home     alt + ctrl +<b> h </b>
<br/>
       PgDn     alt + ctrl +<b> j </b>
<br/>
       PgUp     alt + ctrl +<b> k </b>
<br/>
       End      alt + ctrl +<b> l </b></pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys have special significance
    when prompted for line input terminated with the &lt;Enter&gt; key. Those
    keys, or their aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines which
    can then be edited and re-input. And there are four additional keys
    available with line oriented input.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
      <i> key      special-significance </i>
<br/>
       Up       recall <b>older</b> strings for re-editing
<br/>
       Down     recall <b>newer</b> strings or <b>erase</b> entire line
<br/>
       Insert   toggle between <b>insert</b> and <b>overtype</b> modes
<br/>
       Delete   character <b>removed</b> at cursor, moving others left
<br/>
       Home     jump to <b>beginning</b> of input line
<br/>
       End      jump to <b>end</b> of input line</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Linux_Memory_Types"><a class="permalink" href="#Linux_Memory_Types">Linux
  Memory Types</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For our purposes there are three types of memory, and one is
    optional. First is physical memory, a limited resource where code and data
    must reside when executed or referenced. Next is the optional swap file,
    where modified (dirty) memory can be saved and later retrieved if too many
    demands are made on physical memory. Lastly we have virtual memory, a nearly
    unlimited resource serving the following goals:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
   1. abstraction, free from physical memory addresses/limits
<br/>
   2. isolation, every process in a separate address space
<br/>
   3. sharing, a single mapping can serve multiple needs
<br/>
   4. flexibility, assign a virtual address to a file</pre>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of which of these forms memory may take, all are
    managed as pages (typically 4096 bytes) but expressed by default in top as
    KiB (kibibyte). The memory discussed under topic `2c. MEMORY Usage' deals
    with physical memory and the swap file for the system as a whole. The memory
    reviewed in topic `3. FIELDS / Columns Display' embraces all three memory
    types, but for individual processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each such process, every memory page is restricted to a single
    quadrant from the table below. Both physical memory and virtual memory can
    include any of the four, while the swap file only includes #1 through #3.
    The memory in quadrant #4, when modified, acts as its own dedicated swap
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">The following may help in interpreting process level memory values
    displayed as scalable columns and discussed under topic `3a. DESCRIPTIONS of
    Fields'.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
   %MEM - simply RES divided by total physical memory
<br/>
   CODE - the `pgms' portion of quadrant <b>3</b>
<br/>
   DATA - the entire quadrant <b>1</b> portion of VIRT plus all
<br/>
          explicit mmap file-backed pages of quadrant <b>3</b>
<br/>
   RES  - anything occupying physical memory which, beginning with
<br/>
          Linux-4.5, is the sum of the following three fields:
<br/>
          RSan - quadrant <b>1</b> pages, which include any
<br/>
                 former quadrant <b>3</b> pages if modified
<br/>
          RSfd - quadrant <b>3</b> and quadrant <b>4</b> pages
<br/>
          RSsh - quadrant <b>2</b> pages
<br/>
   RSlk - subset of RES which cannot be swapped out (any quadrant)
<br/>
   SHR  - subset of RES (excludes <b>1</b>, includes all <b>2</b> &amp; <b>4</b>, some <b>3</b>)
<br/>
   SWAP - potentially any quadrant except <b>4</b>
<br/>
   USED - simply the sum of RES and SWAP
<br/>
   VIRT - everything in-use and/or reserved (all quadrants)</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: Even though program images and shared libraries are
    considered <i>private</i> to a process, they will be accounted for as
    <i>shared</i> (SHR) by the kernel.</p>

  TASK and CPU States</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This portion consists of a minimum of two lines. In an SMP
    environment, additional lines can reflect individual CPU state
  percentages.</p>
<p class="Pp">Line 1 shows total<b> tasks</b> or<b> threads</b>, depending on
    the state of the Threads-mode toggle. That total is further classified
  as:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
    running; sleeping; stopped; zombie</pre>
<p class="Pp">Line 2 shows CPU state percentages based on the interval since the
    last refresh.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a default, percentages for these individual categories are
    displayed. Depending on your kernel version, the <b>st</b> field may not be
    shown.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
    <b>us</b> : time running un-niced user processes
<br/>
    <b>sy</b> : time running kernel processes
<br/>
    <b>ni</b> : time running niced user processes
<br/>
    <b>id</b> : time spent in the kernel idle handler
<br/>
    <b>wa</b> : time waiting for I/O completion
<br/>
    <b>hi</b> : time spent servicing hardware interrupts
<br/>
    <b>si</b> : time spent servicing software interrupts
<br/>
    <b>st</b> : time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor</pre>
<p class="Pp">The `sy' value above also reflects the time running a virtual cpu
    for guest operating systems, including those that have been niced.</p>
<p class="Pp">Beyond the first tasks/threads line, there are alternate CPU
    display modes available via the 4-way `t' command toggle. They show an
    abbreviated summary consisting of these elements:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
               a    b     c    d
<br/>
    %Cpu(s):  <b>75.0</b>/25.0  <b>100</b>[ ... ]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Where: a) is the `user' (us + ni) percentage; b) is the `system'
    (sy + hi + si + guests) percentage; c) is the total percentage; and d) is
    one of two visual graphs of those representations. Such graphs also reflect
    separate `user' and `system' portions.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the `4' command toggle is used to yield more than two cpus per
    line, results will be further abridged eliminating the a) and b) elements.
    However, that information is still reflected in the graph itself assuming
    color is active or, if not, bars vs. blocks are being shown.</p>

    the `t' and `4' command toggles.</p>

  MEMORY Usage</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This portion consists of two lines which may express values in
    kibibytes (KiB) through exbibytes (EiB) depending on the scaling factor
    enforced with the `E' interactive command. The /proc/meminfo source fields
    are shown in parenthesis.</p>
<p class="Pp">Line 1 reflects physical memory, classified as:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
    total          ( MemTotal )
<br/>
    free           ( MemFree )
<br/>
    used           ( MemTotal - MemAvailable )
<br/>
    buff/cache     ( Buffers + Cached + SReclaimable )</pre>
<p class="Pp">Line 2 reflects mostly virtual memory, classified as:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
    total          ( SwapTotal )
<br/>
    free           ( SwapFree )
<br/>
    used           ( SwapTotal - SwapFree )
<br/>
    avail          ( MemAvailable, which is physical memory )</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>avail</b> number on line 2 is an estimation of physical
    memory available for starting new applications, without swapping. Unlike the
    <b>free</b> field, it attempts to account for readily reclaimable page cache
    and memory slabs. It is available on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels
    2.6.27+, otherwise the same as <b>free</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the alternate memory display modes, two abbreviated summary
    lines are shown consisting of these elements:</p>
<pre>
<br/>
               a    b          c
<br/>
    GiB Mem : <b>18.7</b>/15.738   [ ... ]
<br/>
    GiB Swap: <b> 0.0</b>/7.999    [ ... ]</pre>
<p class="Pp">Where: a) is the percentage used; b) is the total available; and
    c) is one of two visual graphs of those representations.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the case of physical memory, the percentage represents the
    <b>total</b> minus the estimated <b>avail</b> noted above. The `Mem' graph
    itself is divided between the non-cached portion of <b>used</b> and any
    remaining memory not otherwise accounted for by <b>avail</b>. See topic 4b.

  DESCRIPTIONS of Fields</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Listed below are top's available process fields (columns). They
    are shown in strict ascii alphabetical order. You may customize their
    position and whether or not they are displayable with the `f' (Fields
    Management) interactive command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether
    they are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high. For additional information on
    sort provisions see topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fields related to physical memory or virtual memory reference
    `(KiB)' which is the unsuffixed display mode. Such fields may, however, be
    scaled from KiB through PiB. That scaling is influenced via the `e'
    interactive command or established for startup through a build option.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>%CPU </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0; CPU Usage </dt>
  <dd>The task's share of the elapsed CPU time since the last screen update,
      expressed as a percentage of total CPU time.
    <p class="Pp">In a true SMP environment, if a process is multi-threaded and
        top is <i>not</i> operating in Threads mode, amounts greater than 100%
        may be reported. You toggle Threads mode with the `H' interactive
        command.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also for multi-processor environments, if Irix mode is
        <i>Off</i>, top will operate in Solaris mode where a task's cpu usage
        will be divided by the total number of CPUs. You toggle Irix/Solaris
        modes with the `I' interactive command.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: When running in forest view mode (`V') with
        children collapsed (`v'), this field will also include the CPU time of
        those unseen children. See topic 4c. TASK AREA Commands, CONTENT for
        more information regarding the `V' and `v' toggles.</p>

  <dt><b>%CUC </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0; CPU Utilization </dt>

  </dd>
  <dt><b>%CUU </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0; CPU Utilization </dt>
  <dd>A task's total CPU usage divided by its elapsed running time, expressed as
      a percentage.
    <p class="Pp">If a process currently displays high CPU usage, this field can
        help determine if such behavior is normal. Conversely, if a process has
        low CPU usage currently, %CUU may reflect historically higher demands
        over its lifetime.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>%MEM </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0; Memory Usage (RES) </dt>

  <dt id="AGID"><a class="permalink" href="#AGID"><b>AGID </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0;
    Autogroup Identifier </a></dt>
  <dd>The autogroup identifier associated with a process. This feature operates
      in conjunction with the CFS scheduler to improve interactive desktop
      performance.
    <p class="Pp">When /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled is set, a new
        autogroup is created with each new session (see SID). All subsequently
        forked processes in that session inherit membership in this autogroup.
        The kernel then attempts to equalize distribution of CPU cycles across
        such groups. Thus, an autogroup with many CPU intensive processes (e.g
        make -j) will not dominate an autogroup with only one or two
      processes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When -1 is displayed it means this information is not

      group. A negative nice value means higher priority, whereas a positive
      nice value means lower priority.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="CGNAME"><a class="permalink" href="#CGNAME"><b>CGNAME
    </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0; Control Group Name </a></dt>
  <dd>The name of the control group to which a process belongs, or `-' if not
      applicable for that process.
    <p class="Pp">This will typically be the last entry in the full list of
        control groups as shown under the next heading (CGROUPS). And as is true

  <dt id="CGROUPS"><a class="permalink" href="#CGROUPS"><b>CGROUPS

  <dd>The names of the control group(s) to which a process belongs, or `-' if
      not applicable for that process.
    <p class="Pp">Control Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory,
        network bandwidth, etc.) among installation-defined groups of processes.
        They enable fine-grained control over allocating, denying, prioritizing,
        managing and monitoring those resources.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously
        on a system and each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems. A
        subsystem represents a single resource.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: The CGROUPS field, unlike most columns, is not
        fixed-width. When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns
        will be allocated all remaining screen width (up to the maximum 512

  <dd>Display the command line used to start a task or the name of the
      associated program. You toggle between command<i> line</i> and<i> name</i>
      with `c', which is both a command-line option and an interactive command.
    <p class="Pp">When you've chosen to display command lines, processes without
        a command line (like kernel threads) will be shown with only the program
        name in brackets, as in this example:
      <br/>

      started task will display the smallest time interval.
    <p class="Pp">The value will be expressed as `HH,MM' (hours,minutes) but is
        subject to additional scaling if the interval becomes too great to fit
        column width. At that point it will be scaled to `DD+HH' (days+hours)

    <p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: The ENVIRON field, unlike most columns, is not
        fixed-width. When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns

  <dd>A number representing the last used processor. In a true SMP environment
      this will likely change frequently since the kernel intentionally uses
      weak affinity. Also, the very act of running top may break this weak
      affinity and cause more processes to change CPUs more often (because of
      the extra demand for cpu time).

    Process Group Id </a></dt>
  <dd>Every process is member of a unique process group which is used for
      distribution of signals and by terminals to arbitrate requests for their
      input and output. When a process is created (forked), it becomes a member
      of the process group of its parent. By convention, this value equals the
      process ID (see PID) of the first member of a process group, called the

  <dt id="PR"><a class="permalink" href="#PR"><b>PR </b>&#x00A0;--&#x00A0;
    Priority </a></dt>
  <dd>The scheduling priority of the task. If you see `rt' in this field, it
      means the task is running under real time scheduling priority.
    <p class="Pp">Under linux, real time priority is somewhat misleading since
        traditionally the operating itself was not preemptible. And while the
        2.6 kernel can be made mostly preemptible, it is not always so.</p>

    <p class="Pp">For example, if a process has 1000 resident pages alone and

  <dd>A subset of the virtual address space (VIRT) representing the non-swapped
      physical memory a task is currently using. It is also the sum of the
      `RSan', `RSfd' and `RSsh' fields.
    <p class="Pp">It can include private anonymous pages, private pages mapped
        to files (including program images and shared libraries) plus shared
        anonymous pages. All such memory is backed by the swap file represented
        separately under SWAP.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Lastly, this field may also include shared file-backed pages
        which, when modified, act as a dedicated swap file and thus will never
        impact SWAP.</p>

    <p class="Pp">While normally each cpu is displayed as `%Cpu0, %Cpu1, ...',
        this toggle can be used to identify and/or filter those cpus by their
        core type, either P-Core (performance) or E-Core (efficient).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The 1st time `5' is struck, each CPU is displayed as
        `%Cp<b>P</b>' or `%Cp<b>E</b>' representing the two core types. The 2nd
        time, only P-Cores (%Cp<b>P</b>) will be shown. The 3rd time, only
        E-Cores (%Cp<b>E</b>) are displayed. When this command toggle is struck
        for the 4th time, the CPU display returns to the normal `%Cpu'
        convention.</p>

    toggle </dt>
  <dd>This command toggle is intended for massively parallel SMP environments
      where, even with the `4' command toggle, not all processors can be
      displayed. With each press of `!' the number of cpus combined is doubled
      thus reducing the total number of cpu lines displayed.
    <p class="Pp">For example, with the first press of `!' two cpus will be
        combined and displayed as `0-1, 2-3, ...' instead of the normal `%Cpu0,
        %Cpu1, %Cpu2, %Cpu3, ...'. With a second `!' command toggle four cpus
        are combined and shown as `0-3, 4-7, ...'. Then the third `!' press,
        combining eight cpus, shows as `0-7, 8-15, ...', etc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Such progression continues until individual cpus are again
        displayed and impacts both the `1' and `4' toggles (one or multiple
        columns). Use the `=' command to exit <b>Combine Cpus</b> mode.</p>

  FILTERING in a Window</a></h2>

    and 3) a selection value, as a minimum. This is the most complex of top's

    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Input Requirements</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must
    take one of two forms. There are 3 required pieces of information, with a
    4th as optional. These examples use spaces for clarity but your input
    generally would not.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
        #1           <b>#2</b>  #3              ( required )
<br/>
        Field-Name   ?   include-if-value
<br/>
     <b>!</b>  Field-Name   ?   <b>exclude</b>-if-value
<br/>
     #4                                  ( optional )</pre>
<p class="Pp">Items #1, #3 and #4 should be self-explanatory. Item <b>#2</b>
    represents both a required <i>delimiter</i> and the <i>operator</i> which
    must be one of either equality (`=') or relation (`&lt;' or `&gt;').</p>
<p class="Pp">The `=' equality operator requires only a partial match and that
    can reduce your `if-value' input requirements. The `&gt;' or `&lt;'
    relational operators always employ string comparisons, even with numeric
    fields. They are designed to work with a field's default
    <i>justification</i> and with homogeneous data. When some field's numeric
    amounts have been subjected to <i>scaling</i> while others have not, that
    data is no longer homogeneous.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you establish a relational filter and you <b>have</b> changed
    the default Numeric or Character <i>justification</i>, that filter is likely
    to fail. When a relational filter is applied to a memory field and you
    <b>have not</b> changed the <i>scaling</i>, it may produce misleading
    results. This happens, for example, because `100.0m' (MiB) would appear
    greater than `1.000g' (GiB) when compared as strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering
    justification or scaling may yet achieve the desired objective. See the `j',
    `J' and `e' interactive commands for additional information.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Potential Problems</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">These <b>GROUP</b> filters could produce the exact same results or
    the second one might not display anything at all, just a blank task
  window.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
     GROUP=root        ( only the same results when )
<br/>
     GROUP=ROOT        ( invoked via lower case `o' )</pre>
<p class="Pp">Either of these <b>RES</b> filters might yield inconsistent and/or
    misleading results, depending on the current memory scaling factor. Or both
    filters could produce the exact same results.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
     RES&gt;9999          ( only the same results when )
<br/>
     !RES&lt;10000        ( memory scaling is at `KiB' )</pre>
<p class="Pp">This <b>nMin</b> filter illustrates a problem unique to scalable
    fields. This particular field can display a maximum of 4 digits, beyond
    which values are automatically scaled to KiB or above. So while amounts
    greater than 9999 exist, they will appear as 2.6m, 197k, etc.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
     nMin&gt;9999         ( always a blank task window )</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Potential Solutions</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">These examples illustrate how Other Filtering can be creatively
    applied to achieve almost any desired result. Single quotes are sometimes
    shown to delimit the spaces which are part of a filter or to represent a
    request for status (^O) accurately. But if you used them with if-values in
    real life, no matches would be found.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assuming field <b>nTH</b> is displayed, the first filter will
    result in only multi-threaded processes being shown. It also reminds us that
    a trailing space is part of every displayed field. The second filter
    achieves the exact same results with less typing.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
     !nTH=` 1 '                ( ` for clarity only )
<br/>
     nTH&gt;1                     ( same with less i/p )</pre>
<p class="Pp">With Forest View mode active and the <b>COMMAND</b> column in
    view, this filter effectively collapses child processes so that just 3
    levels are shown.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
     !COMMAND=`       `- '     ( ` for clarity only )</pre>
<p class="Pp">The final two filters appear as in response to the status request
    key (^O). In reality, each filter would have required separate input. The
    <b>PR</b> example shows the two concurrent filters necessary to display
    tasks with priorities of 20 or more, since some might be negative. Then by
    exploiting trailing spaces, the <b>nMin</b> series of filters could achieve
    the failed `9999' objective discussed above.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
     `PR&gt;20' + `!PR=-'         ( 2 for right result )
<br/>
     `!nMin=0 ' + `!nMin=1 ' + `!nMin=2 ' + `!nMin=3 ' ...</pre>

  ADDING INSPECT Entries</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To exploit the `Y' interactive command, you must add entries at
    the<b> end</b> of the top personal configuration file. Such entries simply
    reflect a file to be read or command/pipeline to be executed whose results
    will then be displayed in a separate scrollable, searchable window.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't know the location or name of your top rcfile, use the
    `W' interactive command to rewrite it and note those details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing
    the configuration file. Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the rcfile
    should it replace (&gt;) rather than append (&gt;&gt;) to that file.
    Conversely, when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt existing
    lines, some of which could contain unprintable data or unusual characters
    depending on the top version under which that configuration file was
  saved.</p>
<p class="Pp">Those Inspect entries beginning with a `#' character are ignored,
    regardless of content. Otherwise they consist of the following 3 elements,
    each of which<i> must</i> be separated by a tab character (thus 2 `\t'
    total):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
  .type:  literal `file' or `pipe'
<br/>
  .name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen
<br/>
  .fmts:  string representing a path or command</pre>
<p class="Pp">The two types of Inspect entries are<i> not</i> interchangeable.
    Those designated `<b>file</b>' will be accessed using fopen and must
    reference a single file in the `.fmts' element. Entries specifying
    `<b>pipe</b>' will employ popen, their `.fmts' element could contain many
    pipelined commands and, none can be interactive.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the file or pipeline represented in your `.fmts' deals with the
    specific PID input or accepted when prompted, then the format string must
    also contain the `<b>%d</b>' specifier, as these examples illustrate.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
  .fmts=  /proc/<i>%d</i>/numa_maps
<br/>
  .fmts=  lsof -P -p<i> %d</i></pre>
<p class="Pp">For `<b>pipe</b>' type entries only, you may also wish to redirect
    stderr to stdout for a more comprehensive result. Thus the format string
    becomes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
  .fmts=  pmap -x %d<i> 2&gt;&amp;1</i></pre>
<p class="Pp">Here are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might
    appear in the rcfile. The first entry will be ignored due to the initial `#'
    character. For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions (^I) are surrounded by an
    extra space but the actual tabs would not be.</p>
<pre>
<br/>
  # pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2&gt;&amp;1
<br/>
  pipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&amp;1
<br/>
  file ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps
<br/>
  pipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr</pre>
<p class="Pp">Except for the commented entry above, these next examples show
    what could be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the rcfile name
    was `.toprc'. However, due to the embedded tab characters, each of these
    lines should be preceded by `<b>/bin/echo -e</b>', not just a simple an
    `echo', to enable backslash interpretation regardless of which shell you
    use.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">If any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable
    characters they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or hexadecimal
    &lt;FF&gt; form, depending on their value. This applies to tab characters as
    well, which will show as `^I'. If you want a truer representation, any
    embedded tabs should be expanded. The following example takes what could
    have been a `file' entry but employs a `pipe' instead so as to expand the
    embedded tabs.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
  # next would have contained `\t' ...
<br/>
  # file ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I /proc/%d/status
<br/>
  # but this will eliminate embedded `\t' ...
<br/>
  pipe ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand -</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: Some programs might rely on <i>SIGINT</i> to end.
    Therefore, if a `<b>pipe</b>' such as the following is established, one must
    use Ctrl-C to terminate it in order to review the results. This is the
    single occasion where a `^C' will not also terminate top.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
  pipe ^I Trace ^I /usr/bin/strace -p %d 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
<p class="Pp">Lastly, while `<b>pipe</b>' type entries have been discussed in
    terms of pipelines and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from
    including <i> shell scripts</i> as well. Perhaps even newly created scripts
    designed specifically for the `Y' interactive command.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over
    time, the `Options:' row will be truncated when screen width is exceeded.
    That does not affect operation other than to make some selections invisible.
    However, if some choices are lost to truncation but you want to see more
    options, there is an easy solution hinted at below.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
  Inspection Pause at pid ...
<br/>
  Use:  left/right then &lt;Enter&gt; ...
<br/>
  Options:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">The entries in the top rcfile would have a number for the `.name'
    element and the `help' entry would identify a shell script you've written
    explaining what those numbered selections actually mean. In that way, many
    more choices can be made visible.</p>

  STUPID TRICKS Sampler</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many of these tricks work best when you give top a scheduling

  Kernel Magic</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For these stupid tricks, top needs full-screen mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The user interface, through prompts and help, intentionally implies that
      the delay interval is limited to tenths of a second. However, you're free
      to set any desired delay. If you want to see Linux at his scheduling best,
      try a delay of .09 seconds or less.
    <p class="Pp">For this experiment, under x-windows open an xterm and
        maximize it. Then do the following:</p>
    <pre>
<br/>
  . provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:
<br/>
      nice -n -10 top -d.09
<br/>
  . keep sorted column highlighting <i>Off</i> so as to
<br/>
    minimize path length
<br/>
  . turn <i>On</i> reverse row highlighting for emphasis
<br/>
  . try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well),
<br/>
    and normal or reverse sorts to bring the most
<br/>
    active processes into view</pre>
    <p class="Pp">What you'll see is a very busy Linux doing what he's always
        done for you, but there was no program available to illustrate this.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Under an xterm using `white-on-black' colors, on top's Color Mapping
      screen set the task color to black and be sure that task highlighting is
      set to bold, not reverse. Then set the delay interval to around .3
      seconds.
    <p class="Pp">After bringing the most active processes into view, what
        you'll see are the ghostly images of just the currently running
      tasks.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink. Start this new
      version then type `T' (a secret key, see topic 4c. Task Area Commands,
      SORTING) followed by `W' and `q'. Finally, restart the program with -d0
      (zero delay).
    <p class="Pp">Your display will be refreshed at three times the rate of the
        former top, a 300% speed advantage. As top climbs the TIME ladder, be as
        patient as you can while speculating on whether or not top will ever
        reach the top.</p>

<p class="Pp">For these stupid tricks, top needs alternate-display mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>With 3 or 4 task displays visible, pick any window other than the last and
      turn idle processes <i>Off</i> using the `i' command toggle. Depending on
      where you applied `i', sometimes several task displays are bouncing and
      sometimes it's like an accordion, as top tries his best to allocate space.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Set each window's summary lines differently: one with no memory (`m');
      another with no states (`t'); maybe one with nothing at all, just the
      message line. Then hold down `a' or `w' and watch a variation on bouncing
      windows &#x00A0;--&#x00A0; hopping windows.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to
      <i>Off</i> using the `i' command toggle. You've just entered the
      &quot;extreme bounce&quot; zone.

    <p class="Pp">When they've all been displaced, toggle between all
        visible/invisible windows using the `_' command toggle. Then ponder

        that some truncated command lines are shown (`+' in last position). You

        right justified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Now use the right arrow key to reach the COMMAND column.
