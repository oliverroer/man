<p class="Pp">The <b>gzip</b> command reduces the size of the named files using
    Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one
    with the extension <b>.gz</b>, while keeping the same ownership modes,
    access and modification times. (The default extension is <b>z</b> for MSDOS,
    OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If no files are specified, or if a file
    name is &quot;-&quot;, the standard input is compressed to the standard
    output. The <b>gzip</b> command will only attempt to compress regular files.
    In particular, it will ignore symbolic links.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the compressed file name is too long for its file system,
    <b>gzip</b> truncates it. The <b>gzip</b> command attempts to truncate only
    the parts of the file name longer than 3 characters. (A part is delimited by
    dots.) If the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are
    truncated. For example, if file names are limited to 14 characters,
    gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated on
    systems which do not have a limit on file name length.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>gzip</b> keeps the original file name and timestamp
    in the compressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the
    <b>-N</b> option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated
    or when the timestamp was not preserved after a file transfer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Compressed files can be restored to their original form using
    <b>gzip -d</b> or <b>gunzip</b> or <b>zcat</b>. If the original name saved
    in the compressed file is not suitable for its file system, a new name is
    constructed from the original one to make it legal.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>gunzip</b> takes a list of files on its command line and
    replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring
    case) and which begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed
    file without the original extension. <b>gunzip</b> also recognizes the
    special extensions <b>.tgz</b> and <b>.taz</b> as shorthands for
    <b>.tar.gz</b> and <b>.tar.Z</b> respectively. When compressing, <b>gzip</b>
    uses the <b>.tgz</b> extension if necessary instead of truncating a file
    with a <b>.tar</b> extension.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>gunzip</b> can currently decompress files created by
    <b>gzip</b>, <b>zip</b>, <b>compress</b>, <b>compress -H</b> or <b>pack</b>.
    The detection of the input format is automatic. When using the first two
    formats, <b>gunzip</b> checks a 32 bit CRC. For <b>pack</b> and
    <b>gunzip</b> checks the uncompressed length. The standard <b>compress</b>
    format was not designed to allow consistency checks. However <b>gunzip</b>
    is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when
    uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply
    because the standard <b>uncompress</b> does not complain. This generally
    means that the standard <b>uncompress</b> does not check its input, and
    happily generates garbage output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh
    compression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency
    checks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files created by <b>zip</b> can be uncompressed by gzip only if
    they have a single member compressed with the 'deflation' method. This
    feature is only intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz
    format. To extract a <b>zip</b> file with a single member, use a command
    like '<b>gunzip &lt;foo.zip</b>' or '<b>gunzip -S .zip foo.zip</b>'. To
    extract zip files with several members, use <b>unzip</b> instead of
    <b>gunzip</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>zcat</b> command is identical to <b>gunzip</b> <b>-c</b>.
    (On some systems, <b>zcat</b> may be installed as <b>gzcat</b> to preserve
    the original link to <b>compress</b>.) <b>zcat</b> uncompresses either a
    list of files on the command line or its standard input and writes the
    uncompressed data on standard output. <b>zcat</b> will uncompress files that
    have the correct magic number whether they have a <b>.gz</b> suffix or
  not.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>gzip</b> command uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in
    <b>zip</b> and PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size
    of the input and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such
    as source code or English is reduced by 60-70%. Compression is generally
    much better than that achieved by LZW (as used in <b>compress</b>), Huffman
    coding (as used in <b>pack</b>), or adaptive Huffman coding
    (<b>compact</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file is
    slightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few bytes
    for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes per 32&#x00A0;KiB block, or an
    expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. The actual number of used disk
    blocks almost never increases.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>gzip</b> normally preserves the mode and modification timestamp
    of a file when compressing or decompressing. If you have appropriate
    privileges, it also preserves the file's owner and group.</p>

  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n --no-name</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When compressing, do not save the original file name and timestamp by
      default. (The original name is always saved if the name had to be
      truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if
      present (remove only the <b>gzip</b> suffix from the compressed file name)
      and do not restore the original timestamp if present (copy it from the
      compressed file). This option is the default when decompressing.</dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><b>-N --name</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When compressing, always save the original file name, and save the seconds
      part of the original modification timestamp if the original is a regular
      file and its timestamp is at least 1 (1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC) and is less
      than 2**32 (2106-02-07 06:28:16 UTC, assuming leap seconds are not
      counted); this is the default. When decompressing, restore from the saved
      file name and timestamp if present. This option is useful on systems which
      have a limit on file name length or when the timestamp has been lost after
      a file transfer.</dd>

  <dd>Suppress all warnings.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r --recursive</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names
      specified on the command line are directories, <b>gzip</b> will descend
      into the directory and compress all the files it finds there (or
      decompress them in the case of <b>gunzip</b> ).</dd>
  <dt id="S"><a class="permalink" href="#S"><b>-S .suf --suffix
    .suf</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When compressing, use suffix .suf instead of .gz. Any non-empty suffix can
      be given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz should be avoided to avoid
      confusion when files are transferred to other systems.
    <p class="Pp">When decompressing, add .suf to the beginning of the list of
        suffixes to try, when deriving an output file name from an input file
        name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="synchronous"><a class="permalink" href="#synchronous"><b>--synchronous</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use synchronous output. With this option, <b>gzip</b> is less likely to
      lose data during a system crash, but it can be considerably slower.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t --test</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Test. Check the compressed file integrity then quit.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v --verbose</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file
      compressed or decompressed.</dd>
  <dt id="V"><a class="permalink" href="#V"><b>-V --version</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Version. Display the version number and compilation options then
    quit.</dd>
  <dt><b>-# --fast --best</b></dt>
  <dd>Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit <b>#</b>,
      where <b>-1</b> or <b>--fast</b> indicates the fastest compression method
      (less compression) and <b>-9</b> or <b>--best</b> indicates the slowest
      compression method (best compression). The default compression level is
      <b>-6</b> (that is, biased towards high compression at expense of
    speed).</dd>
  <dt id="rsyncable"><a class="permalink" href="#rsyncable"><b>--rsyncable</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When you synchronize a compressed file between two computers, this option
      allows rsync to transfer only files that were changed in the archive
      instead of the entire archive. Normally, after a change is made to any
      file in the archive, the compression algorithm can generate a new version
      of the archive that does not match the previous version of the archive. In
      this case, rsync transfers the entire new version of the archive to the
      remote computer. With this option, rsync can transfer only the changed
      files as well as a small amount of metadata that is required to update the
      archive structure in the area that was changed.</dd>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case,
    <b>gunzip</b> will extract all members at once. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   gzip -c file1 &gt; foo.gz
  <br/>
   gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz</p>
<p class="Pp">Then</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   gunzip -c foo</p>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   cat file1 file2</p>
<p class="Pp">In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can
    still be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However, you can get
    better compression by compressing all members at once:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz</p>
<p class="Pp">compresses better than</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better
    compression, do:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz</p>
<p class="Pp">If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed
    size and CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member only.
    If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can use:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple members
    so that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such
    as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip transparently.
    gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The obsolescent environment variable <b>GZIP</b> can hold a set of
    default options for <b>gzip</b>. These options are interpreted first and can
    be overwritten by explicit command line parameters. As this can cause
    problems when using scripts, this feature is supported only for options that
    are reasonably likely to not cause too much harm, and <b>gzip</b> warns if
    it is used. This feature will be removed in a future release of
  <b>gzip</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use an alias or script instead. For example, if
    <b>gzip</b> is in the directory <b>/usr/bin</b> you can prepend
    <b>$HOME/bin</b> to your <b>PATH</b> and create an executable script
    <b>$HOME/bin/gzip</b> containing the following:</p>
