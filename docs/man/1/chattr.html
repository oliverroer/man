<p class="Pp"><b>chattr</b> changes the file attributes on a Linux file
  system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The format of a symbolic <i>mode</i> is
    <b>+-=</b>[<b>aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux</b>].</p>
<p class="Pp">The operator '<b>+</b>' causes the selected attributes to be added
    to the existing attributes of the files; '<b>-</b>' causes them to be
    removed; and '<b>=</b>' causes them to be the only attributes that the files
    have.</p>
<p class="Pp">The letters '<b>aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux</b>' select the new attributes
    for the files: append only (<b>a</b>), no atime updates (<b>A</b>),
    compressed (<b>c</b>), no copy on write (<b>C</b>), no dump (<b>d</b>),
    synchronous directory updates (<b>D</b>), extent format (<b>e</b>),
    case-insensitive directory lookups (<b>F</b>), immutable (<b>i</b>), data
    journaling (<b>j</b>), don't compress (<b>m</b>), project hierarchy
    (<b>P</b>), secure deletion (<b>s</b>), synchronous updates (<b>S</b>), no
    tail-merging (<b>t</b>), top of directory hierarchy (<b>T</b>), undeletable
    (<b>u</b>), and direct access for files (<b>x</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by
    <b>lsattr</b>(1) but not modified by chattr: encrypted (<b>E</b>), indexed
    directory (<b>I</b>), inline data (<b>N</b>), and verity (<b>V</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all flags are supported or utilized by all file systems; refer
    to file system-specific man pages such as <b>btrfs</b>(5), <b>ext4</b>(5),
    <b>mkfs.f2fs</b>(8), and <b>xfs</b>(5) for more file system-specific
    details.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ATTRIBUTES"><a class="permalink" href="#ATTRIBUTES">ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'a' attribute set can only be opened in append mode for
      writing. Only the superuser or a process possessing the
      CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.</dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>A</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When a file with the 'A' attribute set is accessed, its atime record is
      not modified. This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O for laptop
    systems.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'c' attribute set is automatically compressed on the disk
      by the kernel. A read from this file returns uncompressed data. A write to
      this file compresses data before storing them on the disk. Note: please
      make sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this
      document. (Note: For btrfs, If the 'c' flag is set, then the 'C' flag
      cannot be set. Also conflicts with btrfs mount option 'nodatasum')</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>C</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'C' attribute set will not be subject to copy-on-write
      updates. This flag is only supported on file systems which perform
      copy-on-write. (Note: For btrfs, the 'C' flag should be set on new or
      empty files. If it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it is
      undefined when the blocks assigned to the file will be fully stable. If
      the 'C' flag is set on a directory, it will have no effect on the
      directory, but new files created in that directory will have the No_COW
      attribute set. If the 'C' flag is set, then the 'c' flag cannot be
    set.)</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'd' attribute set is not a candidate for backup when the
      <b>dump</b>(8) program is run.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>D</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When a directory with the 'D' attribute set is modified, the changes are
      written synchronously to the disk; this is equivalent to the 'dirsync'
      mount option applied to a subset of the files.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>e</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The 'e' attribute indicates that the file is using extents for mapping the
      blocks on disk. It may not be removed using <b>chattr</b>(1).</dd>
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><b>E</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file, directory, or symlink with the 'E' attribute set is encrypted by
      the file system. This attribute may not be set or cleared using
      <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).</dd>
  <dt id="F"><a class="permalink" href="#F"><b>F</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A directory with the 'F' attribute set indicates that all the path lookups
      inside that directory are made in a case-insensitive fashion. This
      attribute can only be changed in empty directories on file systems with
      the casefold feature enabled.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'i' attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or
      renamed, no link can be created to this file, most of the file's metadata
      can not be modified, and the file can not be opened in write mode. Only
      the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability
      can set or clear this attribute.</dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I"><b>I</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The 'I' attribute is used by the htree code to indicate that a directory
      is being indexed using hashed trees. It may not be set or cleared using
      <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).</dd>
  <dt id="j"><a class="permalink" href="#j"><b>j</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'j' attribute has all of its data written to the ext3 or
      ext4 journal before being written to the file itself, if the file system
      is mounted with the &quot;data=ordered&quot; or &quot;data=writeback&quot;
      options and the file system has a journal. When the file system is mounted
      with the &quot;data=journal&quot; option all file data is already
      journalled and this attribute has no effect. Only the superuser or a
      process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability can set or clear this
      attribute.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><b>m</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'm' attribute is excluded from compression on file systems
      that support per-file compression.</dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><b>N</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'N' attribute set indicates that the file has data stored
      inline, within the inode itself. It may not be set or cleared using
      <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).</dd>
  <dt id="P"><a class="permalink" href="#P"><b>P</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A directory with the 'P' attribute set will enforce a hierarchical
      structure for project id's. This means that files and directories created
      in the directory will inherit the project id of the directory, rename
      operations are constrained so when a file or directory is moved into
      another directory, that the project ids must match. In addition, a hard
      link to file can only be created when the project id for the file and the
      destination directory match.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When a file with the 's' attribute set is deleted, its blocks are zeroed
      and written back to the disk. Note: please make sure to read the bugs and
      limitations section at the end of this document.</dd>
  <dt id="S"><a class="permalink" href="#S"><b>S</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When a file with the 'S' attribute set is modified, the changes are
      written synchronously to the disk; this is equivalent to the 'sync' mount
      option applied to a subset of the files.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 't' attribute will not have a partial block fragment at
      the end of the file merged with other files (for those file systems which
      support tail-merging). This is necessary for applications such as LILO
      which read the file system directly, and which don't understand
      tail-merged files. Note: As of this writing, the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file
      systems do not support tail-merging.</dd>
  <dt id="T"><a class="permalink" href="#T"><b>T</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A directory with the 'T' attribute will be deemed to be the top of
      directory hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block allocator. This
      is a hint to the block allocator used by ext3 and ext4 that the
      subdirectories under this directory are not related, and thus should be
      spread apart for allocation purposes. For example it is a very good idea
      to set the 'T' attribute on the /home directory, so that /home/john and
      /home/mary are placed into separate block groups. For directories where
      this attribute is not set, the Orlov block allocator will try to group
      subdirectories closer together where possible.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When a file with the 'u' attribute set is deleted, its contents are saved.
      This allows the user to ask for its undeletion. Note: please make sure to
      read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this document.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><b>x</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'x' requests the use of direct access (dax) mode, if the
      kernel supports DAX. This can be overridden by the 'dax=never' mount
      option. For more information see the kernel documentation for dax:
      &lt;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/dax.html&gt;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If the attribute is set on an existing directory, it will be inherited by
      all files and subdirectories that are subsequently created in the
      directory. If an existing directory has contained some files and
      subdirectories, modifying the attribute on the parent directory doesn't
      change the attributes on these files and subdirectories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="V~2"><a class="permalink" href="#V~2"><b>V</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A file with the 'V' attribute set has fs-verity enabled. It cannot be
      written to, and the file system will automatically verify all data read
      from it against a cryptographic hash that covers the entire file's
      contents, e.g. via a Merkle tree. This makes it possible to efficiently
      authenticate the file. This attribute may not be set or cleared using
      <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).</dd>

<p class="Pp">The 'c', 's', and 'u' attributes are not honored by the ext2,
    ext3, and ext4 file systems as implemented in the current mainline Linux
    kernels. Setting 'a' and 'i' attributes will not affect the ability to write
    to already existing file descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp">The 'j' option is only useful for ext3 and ext4 file systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">The 'D' option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and
  later.</p>
