<p class="Pp">The <b>passwd</b> command changes passwords for user accounts. A
    normal user may only change the password for their own account, while the
    superuser may change the password for any account. <b>passwd</b> also
    changes the account or associated password validity period.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Password_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Password_Changes">Password
  Changes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The user is first prompted for their old password, if one is
    present. This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored
    password. The user has only one chance to enter the correct password. The
    superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten passwords may
    be changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the password has been entered, password aging information is
    checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at this time.
    If not, <b>passwd</b> refuses to change the password and exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The
    second entry is compared against the first and both are required to match in
    order for the password to be changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Then, the password is tested for complexity. As a general
    guideline, passwords should consist of 6 to 8 characters including one or
    more characters from each of the following sets:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;lower case alphabetics</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;digits 0 thru 9</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;punctuation marks</div>
<p class="Pp">Care must be taken not to include the system default erase or kill
    characters. <b>passwd</b> will reject any password which is not suitably
    complex.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Hints_for_user_passwords"><a class="permalink" href="#Hints_for_user_passwords">Hints
  for user passwords</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The security of a password depends upon the strength of the
    encryption algorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy <i>UNIX</i>
    System encryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm. More recent
    methods are now recommended (see <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b>). The size of the key
    space depends upon the randomness of the password which is selected.</p>
<p class="Pp">Compromises in password security normally result from careless
    password selection or handling. For this reason, you should not select a
    password which appears in a dictionary or which must be written down. The
    password should also not be a proper name, your license number, birth date,
    or street address. Any of these may be used as guesses to violate system
    security.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can find advice on how to choose a strong password on
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The options which apply to the <b>passwd</b> command are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option can be used only with <b>-S</b> and causes
  show status for all users.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-d</b>, <b>--delete</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Delete a user's password (make it empty). This is a quick
  way to disable a password for an account. It will set the named account
  passwordless.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-e</b>, <b>--expire</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Immediately expire an account's password. This in effect
  can force a user to change their password at the user's next login.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display help message and exit.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-i</b>, <b>--inactive</b>&#x00A0;<i>INACTIVE</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is used to disable an account after the
  password has been expired for a number of days. After a user account has had
  an expired password for <i>INACTIVE</i> days, the user may no longer sign on
  to the account.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-tokens</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Indicate password change should be performed only for
  expired authentication tokens (passwords). The user wishes to keep their
  non-expired tokens as before.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-l</b>, <b>--lock</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Lock the password of the named account. This option
  disables a password by changing it to a value which matches no possible
  encrypted value (it adds a &#x00B4;!&#x00B4; at the beginning of the
  password).
<p class="Pp">Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be
    able to login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key). To
    disable the account, administrators should use <b>usermod --expiredate 1</b>
    (this set the account's expire date to Jan 2, 1970).</p>
<p class="Pp">Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their
    password.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-n</b>, <b>--mindays</b>&#x00A0;<i>MIN_DAYS</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the minimum number of days between password changes
  to <i>MIN_DAYS</i>. A value of zero for this field indicates that the user may
  change their password at any time.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Quiet mode.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-r</b>, <b>--repository</b>&#x00A0;<i>REPOSITORY</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">change password in <i>REPOSITORY</i> repository</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-R</b>, <b>--root</b>&#x00A0;<i>CHROOT_DIR</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use
  the configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only absolute
  paths are supported.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-S</b>, <b>--status</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display account status information. The status
  information consists of 7 fields. The first field is the user's login name.
  The second field indicates if the user account has a locked password (L), has
  no password (NP), or has a usable password (P). The third field gives the date
  of the last password change. The next four fields are the minimum age, maximum
  age, warning period, and inactivity period for the password. These ages are
  expressed in days.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-u</b>, <b>--unlock</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Unlock the password of the named account. This option
  re-enables a password by changing the password back to its previous value (to
  the value before using the <b>-l</b> option).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-w</b>, <b>--warndays</b>&#x00A0;<i>WARN_DAYS</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the number of days of warning before a password
  change is required. The <i>WARN_DAYS</i> option is the number of days prior to
  the password expiring that a user will be warned that their password is about
  to expire.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>-x</b>, <b>--maxdays</b>&#x00A0;<i>MAX_DAYS</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid.
  After <i>MAX_DAYS</i>, the password is required to be changed.
<p class="Pp">Passing the number <i>-1</i> as <i>MAX_DAYS</i> will remove
    checking a password's validity.</p>
