<p class="Pp">apt-transport-https - APT transport for downloading via the HTTP
    Secure protocol (HTTPS)</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This APT transport allows the use of repositories accessed via the
    HTTP Secure protocol (HTTPS), also referred to as HTTP over TLS. It is
    available by default since apt 1.5 and was available before that in the
    package apt-transport-https. Note that a transport is never called directly
    by a user but used by APT tools based on user configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">HTTP is by itself an unencrypted transport protocol (compare
    <b>apt-transport-http</b>(1)), which, as indicated by the appended S, is
    wrapped in an encrypted layer known as Transport Layer Security (TLS) to
    provide end-to-end encryption. A sufficiently capable attacker can still
    observe the communication partners and deeper analysis of the encrypted
    communication might still reveal important details. An overview over
    available alternative transport methods is given in
  <b>sources.list</b>(5).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The HTTPS protocol is based on the HTTP protocol, so all options
    supported by <b>apt-transport-http</b>(1) are also available via
    Acquire::https and will default to the same values specified for
    Acquire::http. This manpage will only document the options <i>unique to
    https</i>.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Server_credentials"><a class="permalink" href="#Server_credentials">Server
  credentials</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default all certificates trusted by the system (see
    ca-certificates package) are used for the verification of the server
    certificate. An alternative certificate authority (CA) can be configured
    with the Acquire::https::CAInfo option and its host-specific option
    Acquire::https::CAInfo::<i>host</i>. The CAInfo option specifies a file made
    up of CA certificates (in PEM format) concatenated together to create the
    chain which APT should use to verify the path from your self-signed root
    certificate. If the remote server provides the whole chain during the
    exchange, the file need only contain the root certificate. Otherwise, the
    whole chain is required. If you need to support multiple authorities, the
    only way is to concatenate everything.</p>
<p class="Pp">A custom certificate revocation list (CRL) can be configured with
    the options Acquire::https::CRLFile and
    Acquire::https::CRLFile::<i>host</i>. As with the previous option, a file in
    PEM format needs to be specified.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Disabling_security"><a class="permalink" href="#Disabling_security">Disabling
  security</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">During server authentication, if certificate verification fails
    for some reason (expired, revoked, man in the middle, etc.), the connection
    fails. This is obviously what you want in all cases and what the default
    value (true) of the option Acquire::https::Verify-Peer and its host-specific
    variant provides. If you know <i>exactly</i> what you are doing, setting
    this option to &quot;false&quot; allows you to skip peer certificate
    verification and make the exchange succeed. Again, this option is for
    debugging or testing purposes only as it removes all security provided by
    the use of HTTPS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly the option Acquire::https::Verify-Host and its
    host-specific variant can be used to deactivate a security feature: The
    certificate provided by the server includes the identity of the server which
    should match the DNS name used to access it. By default, as requested by RFC
    2818, the name of the mirror is checked against the identity found in the
    certificate. This default behavior is safe and should not be changed, but if
    you know that the server you are using has a DNS name which does not match
    the identity in its certificate, you can set the option to
    &quot;false&quot;, which will prevent the comparison from being
  performed.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Client_authentication"><a class="permalink" href="#Client_authentication">Client
  authentication</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Besides supporting password-based authentication (see
    <b>apt_auth.conf</b>(5)) HTTPS also supports authentication based on client
    certificates via Acquire::https::SSLCert and Acquire::https::SSLKey. These
    should be set respectively to the filename of the X.509 client certificate
    and the associated (unencrypted) private key, both in PEM format. In
    practice the use of the host-specific variants of both options is highly
    recommended.</p>
